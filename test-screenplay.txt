FADE IN:

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

A small, bustling coffee shop. Regulars chat at worn wooden tables.

SARAH enters, looking around nervously.

                    SARAH
Hi, I'm here to meet—

                    BARISTA
          (interrupting)
Sarah? He's waiting in the back.

Sarah nods and walks toward the corner booth.

                    JOHN
          (standing up)
Sarah! I'm so glad you came.

                    SARAH
Me too. This is... surreal.

                    JOHN
I know what you mean.

They sit down, awkward silence hanging between them.

CUT TO:

INT. COFFEE SHOP - CORNER BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

Close on their faces as they start to talk.

                    SARAH
So, how long have you known?

                    JOHN
About six months. I wanted to reach
out sooner, but I didn't know how.

FADE OUT.
