### 🎯 Top 5 Missing Features to Prioritize

#### 1. **Lifetime License Option** (CRITICAL - Revenue Loss)

- **Why:** 5 out of 7 competitors offer this ($50-$699 range)
- **Impact:** Many writers prefer one-time payments over subscriptions
- **Recommendation:** $199-299 lifetime (2-3 years of Professional subscription equivalent)
- **Expected Revenue:** 20-30% of users prefer lifetime over subscription

#### 2. **Annual Subscription Discount** (CRITICAL - Conversion Booster)

- **Why:** Every subscription competitor offers 15-30% annual discount
- **Impact:** Increases commitment, reduces churn, predictable revenue
- **Recommendation:**
  - Premium: $8/month billed annually ($96/year vs $120/year monthly)
  - Professional: $16/month billed annually ($192/year vs $240/year monthly)

#### 3. **Scene/Chapter Organization System** (HIGH - Core Writer Need)

- **Why:** Writers work in scenes, not documents. All novel software has this.
- **What to Build:**
  - Drag-and-drop scene reordering
  - Scene cards with summaries
  - POV tracking per scene
  - Scene status (draft/revised/final)
  - Word count per scene
- **Monetization:** Professional tier exclusive

  - Writing streak counter (days in a row)
  - Monthly progress charts
  - Milestone celebrations (10k words, 50k words, etc.)
  - Export progress reports
- **Monetization:** Free tier shows basics, Premium+ shows detailed analytics

#### 5. **Mobile Companion App** (MEDIUM - Market Expansion)

- **Why:** Writers want to write anywhere (Ulysses, Dabble, PWA all have mobile)
- **What to Build:**
  - Lightweight editor for on-the-go writing
  - Cloud sync with desktop version
  - Read-only mode for reviewing
  - Simple note-taking for ideas
- **Monetization:** Premium+ feature, drives desktop subscriptions
