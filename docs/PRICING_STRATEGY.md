- **Real-time inline indicators** (not just a report after analysis)
- **Domain-aware concept detection** (understands subject-specific terminology)
- **Prerequisite violation catching** (prevents student confusion before publishing)
- **Dual-coding analysis** (most tools ignore visual elements)
- **Cognitive load optimization** (automated spacing insights)

### Problem Solved

Educators and content creators spend hours manually checking if their content has:

- Proper paragraph spacing for cognitive load
- Appropriate visual elements (dual-coding)
- Logical concept sequencing
- Clear prerequisite chains

Tome IQ automates this analysis in seconds.

## Monetization Strategy

### Free Tier Design

The free tier is generous enough to demonstrate value but limited enough to encourage upgrades:

- **5,000 words per document** (~20 pages) - Enough for a meaningful chapter
- **3 saved documents maximum** - Real testing without storage abuse
- Users see full spacing + dual-coding analysis capabilities
- Limitations drive upgrade when content volume increases or advanced features needed

### Upgrade Triggers

- **Free → Starter**: User hits 5K word limit or 3-save limit, needs regular analysis
- **Starter → Professional**: User needs unlimited documents, batch processing, or custom libraries
- **Professional → Enterprise**: Team needs collaboration, API access, or white-label solution

### Pricing Psychology

- **$9 entry point**: Lower than Netflix, removes friction for individuals
- **$29 unlimited**: Captures serious daily users at professional tool pricing
- **3x price jump**: Clear value differentiation between tiers

## Market Positioning

Position Tome IQ as a **professional content quality tool** rather than just an educational checker. Comparable to:

- Grammarly (writing quality): $12-15/month
- Hemingway Editor Pro (readability): $19.99 one-time
- ProWritingAid (comprehensive writing): $20/month

Tome IQ offers **cognitive science-backed analysis** that no other tool provides, justifying premium positioning.
