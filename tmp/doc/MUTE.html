APARTMENT - ESTABLISHING - MORNING</p><p>The courtyard apartments are pleasant. Pathways connect each apartment through flowered gardens and sculptured bushes. </p><p>INT. APARTMENT</p><p>A shrine of mythical creatures - elves, gnomes, and leprechauns - sit with a picture of a man and woman that have the whimsical look of fairies. An urn stands out.</p><p>European furniture of a pre-Victorian era adorns the residence. A Tiffany lamp shines on a table.</p><p>A young girl in her early twenties stands near the door when we hear a KNOCK. VIDIA wears a long skirt with lace and ribbons - a Shakespearean aesthetic. Flowers adorn her Pixie style hair.</p><p>She opens the door to a SHERIFF holding a paper. We see a K-9 patch on his sleeve. </p><p>SHERIFF</p><p>Elder or Vidia Noobe?</p><p>VIDIA</p><p>Yes.</p><p>We sense his compassion as he hands her an eviction notice. </p><p>SHERIFF</p><p>I’m sorry I have to give you bad news, but this a Writ of Possession. You have five days to vacate this property.</p><p>She manages a weak smile; closes the door and stares at the notice. </p><p>ELDER walks into the room. She hands him the notice.</p><p>Elder Noobe, mid-twenties, reminds us of Mr. Bean, as he has a slightly outcast aspect to him.</p><p>His messy bohemian bob needs a trim, and his flat-toed shoes and clothes are first-rate Goodwill.</p><p>A lanyard with a note pad and pen hangs from his neck.</p><p>We hear the DRONE of a fly. Elder walks about the room and snatches it with one hand. He walks; opens the door and releases the creature to the morning air.</p><p>VIDIA</p><p>We have no money left from the will and no place to go. I can’t do this alone anymore. You need to get a job Elder. </p><p>EXT. UNEMPLOYMENT OFFICE - ESTABLISHING - MORNING</p><p>People are smoking outside. Cars fill the parking lot.</p><p>INT. UNEMPLOYMENT OFFICE</p><p>Vidia and Elder sit across from a CLERK in a cubicle. Vidia laughs as she plays Pokémon on her cell phone. </p><p>The clerk, her face ravaged by neglect and booze, moves paper in the desk trays. She reminds us of a headmistress in a school for girls - business-like and rule bound.</p><p>Her cube showcases an array of mythical figures, such as elves and pixies. Four-leaf clovers cover the back of her monitor. </p><p>CLERK</p><p>I could have sworn I brought your folder in here with me. </p><p>She leaves the cube.</p><p>Elder picks up a pixie figurine and examines it. </p><p>He quickly puts it down; shakes and rubs his hair as if washing it. </p><p>He bends down and flakes fall into a coffee cup on the desk. The cup emits a fleeting sparkle.</p><p>VIDIA</p><p>Leave the pixie alone Elder. We don’t want to cause any trouble today. It’s important that you pay attention.</p><p>Elder sits; takes out a sanitizer bottle; wipes his hands and brushes back his hair.</p><p>He takes a rubber ball from his pocket and squeezes it.</p><p>The clerk comes back with a folder; sits down and takes a drink from the cup.</p><p>CLERK</p><p>Let’s see. Where were we?</p><p>A co-worker walks in and drops some paperwork in the tray. </p><p>The clerk’s demeanor has changed - her speech slurred; her appearance gassed-up, as if she just closed down Murphy’s bar.</p><p>CLERK (cont'd)</p><p>The reward for a job well done is more work. </p><p>She laughs.</p><p>I have a few jokes about unemployed people. Do you want to hear them?</p><p>(beat)</p><p>It doesn't matter - none of them work. So, tell me again how I can help you?</p><p>VIDIA</p><p>My brother needs a real job.</p><p>The clerk’s head dips forward to the desk and snaps back as to have awoken up from a nap. She puts on her glasses and looks at his application.</p><p>CLERK</p><p>This is your brother? </p><p>She leans across the desk - breasts touching. Elder straightens up.</p><p>VIDIA</p><p>He can hear but talks to you with the paper. </p><p>She takes off her glasses; cleans them and squints at Elder. </p><p>CLERK</p><p>I see. What is your name?</p><p>Elder writes; shows the note.</p><p>The clerk puts on her glasses; ignores the note and looks at the application. </p><p>A co-worker stares over the partition into her cube.</p><p>CLERK (cont'd)</p><p>Well, Newbie. The only job you listed was as a street sweeper. Did they give you a dustpan?</p><p>She laughs hysterically. </p><p>VIDIA</p><p>It’s Noo-Bei. Elder Noobe.</p><p>CLERK</p><p>(serious)</p><p>Were you fired from this job?</p><p>Elder writes. </p><p>She leans across the desk, and again Elder straightens up.</p><p>CLERK (cont'd)</p><p>(sheepishly)</p><p>I got fired once. Don’t want to brag, but I heard that they changed the employee manual after I left. </p><p>(beat)</p><p>Do you have a driver’s license?</p><p>Elder writes. People walk by and look into her cube.</p><p>She leans across the desk, and Elder straightens up.</p><p>CLERK (cont'd)</p><p>I have to be totally honest with you. There’s no jobs for street sweepers. Can you drive a truck?</p><p>Elder looks at her collection. She follows his gaze.</p><p>CLERK (cont'd)</p><p>Do you believe in fairies and leprechauns?</p><p>Elder’s face lights up as he nods. The clerk looks at the monitor as she raises her finger high. It comes down on a key. </p><p>CLERK (cont'd)</p><p>Well, my lucky day. I found a delivery job for you. </p><p>She hands him the printout and takes another drink. </p><p>VIDIA</p><p>Thank you very much.</p><p>Elder and Vidia get up and quickly walk out of the cube. </p><p>The clerk, face down on her desk with the cup in her hand, rears up as a supervisor walks in.</p><p>Elder and Vidia walk fast towards the exit.</p><p>SUPERVISOR</p><p>What’s in the cup Delores? </p><p>(a pause)</p><p>A drink?</p><p>CLERK (O.C.)</p><p>(words slurring)</p><p>No thanks. I already have one.</p><p>INT. ARCH PARCEL SERVICE - MORNING</p><p>A calendar hangs crooked. Papers lay scattered on the desks and floor; a pizza box and empty cola bottle lays on a stack of papers.</p><p>A MECHANIC walks into the office.</p><p>MECHANIC</p><p>I need number four today. Got to do a brake job and change the oil.</p><p>ARCHIE</p><p>Not today. I’ve got two drivers out sick and a shitload of stuff to deliver.</p><p>The mechanic walks out.</p><p>ARCHIE looks at his computer. His wife, EDITH, sits nearby shoveling papers. </p><p>EDITH</p><p>I called back a new driver I just interviewed. Enchanting young man. Ran a street sweeper - clean record. He’ll be here soon.</p><p>Archie appears pleased with himself.</p><p>ARCHIE</p><p>With this new software I’ll be able to keep tabs on him and everyone else who’s screwing me. </p><p>EDITH</p><p>Maybe if we paid them more than minimum wage they would stay with us.</p><p>ARCHIE</p><p>I’m paying them too much now. </p><p>(beat)</p><p>Give the new guy truck two. I’m going to breakfast.</p><p>INT. GLOBAL SHIPPING - LATER</p><p>Elder and Vidia are standing at the front counter. On the counter is the urn and a package wrapped in brown paper. </p><p>Behind the counter we see AGENT #1 looking at his computer. He then places the urn into a green box.</p><p>We hear BREAKING glass in the back room.</p><p>VIDIA</p><p>I don’t know if this is a good idea Elder. Maybe we should let Godmother take care of it.</p><p>AGENT #1</p><p>(never looking up)</p><p>Fairy Falls? We don't go there much. Do you want insurance?</p><p>VIDIA</p><p>We only want the assurance that it will get there.</p><p>AGENT #1</p><p>We take special precautions when shipping the dead...I mean deceased. </p><p>Vidia turns away to play Pokémon. We hear her laugh as her phone RINGS. She answers and listens for a few moments.</p><p>VIDIA</p><p>He will be there.</p><p>Excited, she hangs up and looks at Elder.</p><p>VIDIA (cont'd)</p><p>You got the job. You need to change into something nice. We’ll go home and you can put on those antique cuff links that Godmother gave you for your birthday.</p><p>AGENT #2 walks in from the back room. We hear NOISE from the loading dock. Agent #1 turns to look.</p><p>Elder picks up a label addressed to Fairy Falls, OR and drops it on the floor.</p><p>AGENT #2</p><p>Driver’s leaving. Where are these going?</p><p>AGENT #1</p><p>(confused)</p><p>I think the Internet’s down. I’m going to the back and reboot the router. </p><p>Agent #1 walks into the back room. </p><p>Uh. Fair something. Labels are on the counter. It's the green package.</p><p>Agent #2 takes the Fairville, CA label and sticks it to the green package. He looks around for the other label.</p><p>AGENT #2</p><p>We don’t go to Fairville today. I’ll send it through one of our partners.</p><p>Elder takes the label from the floor and hands it to Agent #2 who adheres it to the brown package and stamps the package "Air freight".</p><p>AGENT #2 (cont'd)</p><p>Thanks. Keep your toes crossed.</p><p>EXT. PIXIE KITCHEN - ESTABLISHING - MORNING</p><p>We see a restaurant with a pixie theme. </p><p>INT. PIXIE KITCHEN</p><p>Three sisters: TREMA - late forties;  - late twenties; ANA - mid-twenties, and SKIPPY - early-twenties are sitting in a large booth. </p><p>Trema, dressed like a countess, has the detachment of trance and looks like her hibernation was cut short.</p><p>TREMA</p><p>(voice of authority)</p><p>You need to deliver a car to Karmina today. I don’t care how you do it.</p><p>Drizzy, plump with perfect hair, pre-occupies herself with her perfectly manicured nails. Her earrings hang like bats from an attic rafter. Dressed for business, but speaks with a stutter. She wriggles her pelvis to signal that she is about to speak.</p><p>(stuttering)</p><p>I’m so hungry I could eat a cow.</p><p>Ana, her big-footed bone-protruding younger sister, clasps her knuckle white hands beneath her chin; the elbows hiding her flat chest under clashing colors. We clearly see that she needs a fashion consultant.</p><p>ANA</p><p>Our people are weak. We need real salesmen with the hearts of killers. Those who would massacre a Mother’s Day parade for a car deal. </p><p>Trema, squinting, stares at Ana with suspicion.</p><p>All the restaurants’ employees are midget-sized and dressed like pixies. </p><p>A breakfast plate held by a tiny hand emerges from the kitchen and scan for an empty space on the warming table. </p><p>COOK (V.O.)</p><p>Order up!</p><p>A WAITRESS comes to the table. </p><p>WAITRESS</p><p>What’s it going to be today ladies?</p><p>Full country breakfast and a side of pancakes.</p><p>Skippy, with high shoulders, has the markings of a mama’s boy: crew-cut; glasses and a bow tie. He stares out the window at a high-school-aged girl in a short dress. </p><p>SKIPPY</p><p>Oatmeal and orange juice. No coffee.</p><p>ANA</p><p>What are you looking at Skippy?</p><p>The waitress looks at Trema.</p><p>WAITRESS</p><p>How about you?</p><p>TREMA</p><p>Just coffee.</p><p>The waitress walks off.</p><p>TREMA (cont'd)</p><p>I don’t think I have to remind you that if you don’t act, we will be working for her tomorrow.</p><p>I don’t know why I stayed. What did Uncle Sam see in that bitch.</p><p>TREMA</p><p>You stayed because you’re too lazy to do anything else. </p><p>Once the lawyer is gone, we will figure out a way to take over. </p><p>ANA</p><p>I’ve got to get home. I’m expecting a package.</p><p>Skippy looks back at the table.</p><p>SKIPPY</p><p>Why don’t we just kill her.</p><p>INT. ARCH PARCEL SERVICE - MORNING</p><p>The mechanic walks in and gives Edith the green package. </p><p>MECHANIC</p><p>Some guy dropped this off; says his company has an account here. </p><p>She makes some notes in a ledger and hands back the package.</p><p>EDITH</p><p>Put it on truck four.</p><p>The mechanic leaves the office as Elder walks in.</p><p>Elder, with a neon blue tie and gold cuff links, stands as if waiting for a dance.</p><p>EDITH (cont'd)</p><p>Thank you for coming back. One of my drivers didn’t show, so I’m going to see how you work out.</p><p>She hands him a clipboard and company coveralls with a logo on the back - Archie's Parcel Service.</p><p>EDITH (cont'd)</p><p>It’s easy. Ring the doorbell and leave the packages by the door. </p><p>She hands him the truck keys and points into the garage at truck four.</p><p>EDITH (cont'd)</p><p>Truck four is loaded and ready to go. You shouldn’t have any problems.</p><p>INT./EXT. KARMINA’S HOUSE - ESTABLISHING - MORNING</p><p>We see an expensive neighborhood. SPRINKLERS ACTIVATE soaking Trema as she walks to the front door.</p><p>INT. KARMINA’S BEDROOM</p><p>Trema walks into KARMINA’s bedroom. Makeup covers the vanity. A collection of dolls is throughout the room.</p><p>Trema takes her lipstick from the nightstand; walks out, and we hear the DOOR SLAM. </p><p>Karmina, a premature erosion of an exceptional beauty with a voice emanating a lack of refinement, sits up in bed and pulls off her night shades.</p><p>INT./EXT. TREMA’S CAR</p><p>Trema SLAMS the car door as KARMINA comes out the front door YELLING.</p><p>KARMINA</p><p>You bitch. I hope she gives you the clap.</p><p>A Leprechaun doll with a four-leaf clover necklace falls from the dash. Trema throws it from the car.</p><p>TREMA</p><p>Keep this crap out of my car.</p><p>KARMINA</p><p>The devil is going to get you.</p><p>TREMA</p><p>Whatever!</p><p>INT. VAN - CITY STREET - MORNING</p><p>A red light hangs at the intersection. Elder looks in the rear-view mirror and sees the green package.</p><p>The light changes. A car comes from the right as he steps on the throttle. He slams on the SQUEALING brakes as he CRASHES into the side of the car driven by Trema.</p><p>EXT. CITY STREET</p><p>A DUMB COP, with a droopy face resembling Bell’s Palsy, holds a driver’s license. He turns to look when he hears the crash. A WOMAN appears put out.</p><p>WOMAN</p><p>Honestly, officer. I wouldn’t have pulled over had I known you were just going to criticize me.</p><p>He FLIPS the ladies license through the open window.</p><p>DUMB COP</p><p>Keep it under a 100.</p><p>EXT. CITY STREET - DAY</p><p>Elder, pinned to the steering wheel, holds the green package. BYSTANDERS pull boxes off to free him; some run off with them. </p><p>The dumb cop arrives and walks to Trema sitting in her car. </p><p>DUMB COP</p><p>What happened?</p><p>Trema holds her neck as she points.</p><p>TREMA</p><p>That imbecile ran a red light. I couldn’t stop.</p><p>A bystander walks over.</p><p>BYSTANDER</p><p>I saw it all officer. Her car ran the red light, and the truck hit her.</p><p>The ambulance arrives, and paramedics put her in a neck brace.  </p><p>DUMB COP</p><p>Where’s the truck driver?</p><p>The bystander points.</p><p>BYSTANDER</p><p>Over there. It’s a miracle he wasn’t hurt.</p><p>Elder sits on the curb and stands as the dumb cop approaches.</p><p>DUMB COP</p><p>Let’s get your version. What happened?</p><p>Elder writes; shows the note. The dumb cop looks askance at the note.</p><p>DUMB COP (cont'd)</p><p>I need to see your license.</p><p>Elder shows his license from the Malibu Raceway Grand Prix.</p><p>The dumb cop looks at both sides of his license; makes some notes, and hands it back.</p><p>DUMB COP (cont'd)</p><p>Okay. You’ll need to file an accident report.</p><p>We see Archie drive up; get out of his car and walk up to the Elder.</p><p>ARCHIE</p><p>Christ all mighty. What have you done to my truck?</p><p>Elder writes.</p><p>ARCHIE (cont'd)</p><p>What the f...?</p><p>and with a faint smile hands the note to Archie.</p><p>ARCHIE (cont'd)</p><p>You’re fucking fired. Do you hear me?</p><p>(beat)</p><p> You can fucking hear me, right?</p><p>Elder nods.</p><p>ARCHIE (cont'd)</p><p>You’re fucking fired!</p><p>Archie looks towards the truck and sees a boy picking up a box and running away.</p><p>ARCHIE (cont'd)</p><p>Hey! You! Get away from my stuff.</p><p>Archie runs after the boy.</p><p>INT. KARMINA’S BEDROOM</p><p>Karmina calls her boyfriend CHICO.</p><p>KARMINA</p><p>Chico? Are you coming?</p><p>CHICO (V.O.)</p><p>I got stuff to do in Miami.</p><p>KARMINA</p><p>You stupid? Forget Miami Chico. Tomorrow we will be rich. We will live in Beverly Hills. You will have all the cars you want. I will buy you a Ferrari.</p><p>CHICO (V.O.)</p><p>I always know one day I'm coming there; I got some business to take care of first. Manny, that cockroach, he ripped me off, and I’m gonna get what’s coming to me. </p><p>KARMINA</p><p>Are you crazy? Forget Manny Chico. You’re just gonna get yourself killed with those Colombians. We gonna have it all tomorrow.</p><p>CHICO (V.O.)</p><p>Not if I kill the cockroaches first. Nobody disrespects me and lives to talk about it.

She has disrespected you.</p><p>INT. CITY BUS - MORNING</p><p>Elder boards a bus. It’s standing room only. A man gets up and lets him sit. Elder places the package on his lap. </p><p>A GIRL, in her early twenties in a summer dress, sits across from him.</p><p>Elder smiles and nods. A MAN and a OLD WOMAN can be seen talking.</p><p>WOMAN (V.O.)</p><p>I saw what you did. It was very kind to give that young man your seat.</p><p>MAN (V.O.)</p><p>I always give up my seat for the elderly or the handicapped. </p><p>WOMAN (V.O.)</p><p>You are wonderful.

Well, you see, I used to be a bus driver and....</p><p>INT./EXT CITY BUS</p><p>A woman with shopping bags waits at the bus stop. Her hair a messy beehive; her face covered by a vintage gas mask. </p><p>The bus stops, and she boards. A BOY sitting next to Elder gets up and goes to the rear. </p><p>The girl stares at the woman as she passes. </p><p>GIRL</p><p>Space, the final frontier.</p><p>The woman sits down next to Elder. </p><p>Elder writes on his notepad.
