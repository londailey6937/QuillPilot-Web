Mute

EXT. APARTMENT - ESTABLISHING - MORNING

The courtyard apartments are pleasant. Pathways connect each apartment through flowered gardens and sculptured bushes. 

INT. APARTMENT

A shrine of mythical creatures - elves, gnomes, and leprechauns - sit with a picture of a man and woman that have the whimsical look of fairies. An urn stands out.

European furniture of a pre-Victorian era adorns the residence. A Tiffany lamp shines on a table.

A young girl in her early twenties stands near the door when we hear a KNOCK. VIDIA wears a long skirt with lace and ribbons - a Shakespearean aesthetic. Flowers adorn her Pixie style hair.

She opens the door to a SHERIFF holding a paper. We see a K-9 patch on his sleeve. 

SHERIFF

Elder or Vidia Noobe?

VIDIA

Yes.

We sense his compassion as he hands her an eviction notice. 

SHERIFF



I’m sorry I have to give you bad news, but this a Writ of Possession. You have five days to vacate this property.

She manages a weak smile; closes the door and stares at the notice. 

ELDER walks into the room. She hands him the notice.

Elder Noobe, mid-twenties, reminds us of Mr. Bean, as he has a slightly outcast aspect to him.

His messy bohemian bob needs a trim, and his flat-toed shoes and clothes are first-rate Goodwill.

A lanyard with a note pad and pen hangs from his neck.

We hear the DRONE of a fly. Elder walks about the room and snatches it with one hand. He walks; opens the door and releases the creature to the morning air.

VIDIA

We have no money left from the will and no place to go. I can’t do this alone anymore. You need to get a job Elder. 

EXT. UNEMPLOYMENT OFFICE - ESTABLISHING - MORNING

People are smoking outside. Cars fill the parking lot.

INT. UNEMPLOYMENT OFFICE

Vidia and Elder sit across from a CLERK in a cubicle. Vidia laughs as she plays Pokémon on her cell phone. 

The clerk, her face ravaged by neglect and booze, moves paper in the desk trays. She reminds us of a headmistress in a school for girls - business-like and rule bound.

Her cube showcases an array of mythical figures, such as elves and pixies. Four-leaf clovers cover the back of her monitor. 

CLERK

I could have sworn I brought your folder in here with me. 

She leaves the cube.

Elder picks up a pixie figurine and examines it. 

He quickly puts it down; shakes and rubs his hair as if washing it. 

He bends down and flakes fall into a coffee cup on the desk. The cup emits a fleeting sparkle.

VIDIA

Leave the pixie alone Elder. We don’t want to cause any trouble today. It’s important that you pay attention.

Elder sits; takes out a sanitizer bottle; wipes his hands and brushes back his hair.

He takes a rubber ball from his pocket and squeezes it.

The clerk comes back with a folder; sits down and takes a drink from the cup.

CLERK

Let’s see. Where were we?

A co-worker walks in and drops some paperwork in the tray. 

The clerk’s demeanor has changed - her speech slurred; her appearance gassed-up, as if she just closed down Murphy’s bar.

CLERK (cont'd)

The reward for a job well done is more work. 

She laughs.

I have a few jokes about unemployed people. Do you want to hear them?

(beat)

It doesn't matter - none of them work. So, tell me again how I can help you?

VIDIA

My brother needs a real job.

The clerk’s head dips forward to the desk and snaps back as to have awoken up from a nap. She puts on her glasses and looks at his application.

CLERK

This is your brother? 

She leans across the desk - breasts touching. Elder straightens up.

VIDIA

He can hear but talks to you with the paper. 

She takes off her glasses; cleans them and squints at Elder. 

CLERK

I see. What is your name?

Elder writes; shows the note.

The clerk puts on her glasses; ignores the note and looks at the application. 

A co-worker stares over the partition into her cube.

CLERK (cont'd)

Well, Newbie. The only job you listed was as a street sweeper. Did they give you a dustpan?

She laughs hysterically. 

VIDIA

It’s Noo-Bei. Elder Noobe.

CLERK

(serious)

Were you fired from this job?

Elder writes. 

She leans across the desk, and again Elder straightens up.

CLERK (cont'd)

(sheepishly)

I got fired once. Don’t want to brag, but I heard that they changed the employee manual after I left. 

(beat)

Do you have a driver’s license?

Elder writes. People walk by and look into her cube.

She leans across the desk, and Elder straightens up.

CLERK (cont'd)

I have to be totally honest with you. There’s no jobs for street sweepers. Can you drive a truck?

Elder looks at her collection. She follows his gaze.

CLERK (cont'd)

Do you believe in fairies and leprechauns?

Elder’s face lights up as he nods. The clerk looks at the monitor as she raises her finger high. It comes down on a key. 

CLERK (cont'd)

Well, my lucky day. I found a delivery job for you. 

She hands him the printout and takes another drink. 

VIDIA

Thank you very much.

Elder and Vidia get up and quickly walk out of the cube. 

The clerk, face down on her desk with the cup in her hand, rears up as a supervisor walks in.

Elder and Vidia walk fast towards the exit.

SUPERVISOR

What’s in the cup Delores? 

(a pause)



A drink?

CLERK (O.C.)

(words slurring)

No thanks. I already have one.

INT. ARCH PARCEL SERVICE - MORNING

A calendar hangs crooked. Papers lay scattered on the desks and floor; a pizza box and empty cola bottle lays on a stack of papers.

A MECHANIC walks into the office.

MECHANIC

I need number four today. Got to do a brake job and change the oil.

ARCHIE

Not today. I’ve got two drivers out sick and a shitload of stuff to deliver.

The mechanic walks out.

ARCHIE looks at his computer. His wife, EDITH, sits nearby shoveling papers. 

EDITH

I called back a new driver I just interviewed. Enchanting young man. Ran a street sweeper - clean record. He’ll be here soon.

Archie appears pleased with himself.

ARCHIE

With this new software I’ll be able to keep tabs on him and everyone else who’s screwing me. 

EDITH

Maybe if we paid them more than minimum wage they would stay with us.

ARCHIE

I’m paying them too much now. 

(beat)

Give the new guy truck two. I’m going to breakfast.

INT. GLOBAL SHIPPING - LATER

Elder and Vidia are standing at the front counter. On the counter is the urn and a package wrapped in brown paper. 

Behind the counter we see AGENT #1 looking at his computer. He then places the urn into a green box.

We hear BREAKING glass in the back room.

VIDIA

I don’t know if this is a good idea Elder. Maybe we should let Godmother take care of it.

AGENT #1

(never looking up)

Fairy Falls? We don't go there much. Do you want insurance?

VIDIA

We only want the assurance that it will get there.

AGENT #1

We take special precautions when shipping the dead...I mean deceased. 

Vidia turns away to play Pokémon. We hear her laugh as her phone RINGS. She answers and listens for a few moments.

VIDIA

He will be there.

Excited, she hangs up and looks at Elder.

VIDIA (cont'd)

You got the job. You need to change into something nice. We’ll go home and you can put on those antique cuff links that Godmother gave you for your birthday.

AGENT #2 walks in from the back room. We hear NOISE from the loading dock. Agent #1 turns to look.

Elder picks up a label addressed to Fairy Falls, OR and drops it on the floor.

AGENT #2

Driver’s leaving. Where are these going?

AGENT #1

(confused)

I think the Internet’s down. I’m going to the back and reboot the router. 

Agent #1 walks into the back room. 



Uh. Fair something. Labels are on the counter. It's the green package.

Agent #2 takes the Fairville, CA label and sticks it to the green package. He looks around for the other label.

AGENT #2

We don’t go to Fairville today. I’ll send it through one of our partners.

Elder takes the label from the floor and hands it to Agent #2 who adheres it to the brown package and stamps the package "Air freight".

AGENT #2 (cont'd)

Thanks. Keep your toes crossed.

EXT. PIXIE KITCHEN - ESTABLISHING - MORNING

We see a restaurant with a pixie theme. 

INT. PIXIE KITCHEN

Three sisters: TREMA - late forties;  - late twenties; ANA - mid-twenties, and SKIPPY - early-twenties are sitting in a large booth. 

Trema, dressed like a countess, has the detachment of trance and looks like her hibernation was cut short.

TREMA

(voice of authority)

You need to deliver a car to Karmina today. I don’t care how you do it.

Drizzy, plump with perfect hair, pre-occupies herself with her perfectly manicured nails. Her earrings hang like bats from an attic rafter. Dressed for business, but speaks with a stutter. She wriggles her pelvis to signal that she is about to speak.



(stuttering)

I’m so hungry I could eat a cow.

Ana, her big-footed bone-protruding younger sister, clasps her knuckle white hands beneath her chin; the elbows hiding her flat chest under clashing colors. We clearly see that she needs a fashion consultant.

ANA

Our people are weak. We need real salesmen with the hearts of killers. Those who would massacre a Mother’s Day parade for a car deal. 

Trema, squinting, stares at Ana with suspicion.

All the restaurants’ employees are midget-sized and dressed like pixies. 

A breakfast plate held by a tiny hand emerges from the kitchen and scan for an empty space on the warming table. 

COOK (V.O.)

Order up!

A WAITRESS comes to the table. 

WAITRESS

What’s it going to be today ladies?



Full country breakfast and a side of pancakes.

Skippy, with high shoulders, has the markings of a mama’s boy: crew-cut; glasses and a bow tie. He stares out the window at a high-school-aged girl in a short dress. 

SKIPPY

Oatmeal and orange juice. No coffee.

ANA

What are you looking at Skippy?

The waitress looks at Trema.

WAITRESS

How about you?

TREMA

Just coffee.

The waitress walks off.

TREMA (cont'd)

I don’t think I have to remind you that if you don’t act, we will be working for her tomorrow.



I don’t know why I stayed. What did Uncle Sam see in that bitch.

TREMA

You stayed because you’re too lazy to do anything else. 



Once the lawyer is gone, we will figure out a way to take over. 

ANA

I’ve got to get home. I’m expecting a package.

Skippy looks back at the table.

SKIPPY

Why don’t we just kill her.

INT. ARCH PARCEL SERVICE - MORNING

The mechanic walks in and gives Edith the green package. 

MECHANIC

Some guy dropped this off; says his company has an account here. 

She makes some notes in a ledger and hands back the package.

EDITH

Put it on truck four.

The mechanic leaves the office as Elder walks in.

Elder, with a neon blue tie and gold cuff links, stands as if waiting for a dance.

EDITH (cont'd)

Thank you for coming back. One of my drivers didn’t show, so I’m going to see how you work out.

She hands him a clipboard and company coveralls with a logo on the back - Archie's Parcel Service.

EDITH (cont'd)

It’s easy. Ring the doorbell and leave the packages by the door. 

She hands him the truck keys and points into the garage at truck four.

EDITH (cont'd)

Truck four is loaded and ready to go. You shouldn’t have any problems.

INT./EXT. KARMINA’S HOUSE - ESTABLISHING - MORNING

We see an expensive neighborhood. SPRINKLERS ACTIVATE soaking Trema as she walks to the front door.

INT. KARMINA’S BEDROOM

Trema walks into KARMINA’s bedroom. Makeup covers the vanity. A collection of dolls is throughout the room.

Trema takes her lipstick from the nightstand; walks out, and we hear the DOOR SLAM. 

Karmina, a premature erosion of an exceptional beauty with a voice emanating a lack of refinement, sits up in bed and pulls off her night shades.

INT./EXT. TREMA’S CAR

Trema SLAMS the car door as KARMINA comes out the front door YELLING.

KARMINA

You bitch. I hope she gives you the clap.

A Leprechaun doll with a four-leaf clover necklace falls from the dash. Trema throws it from the car.

TREMA

Keep this crap out of my car.

KARMINA

The devil is going to get you.

TREMA

Whatever!

INT. VAN - CITY STREET - MORNING

A red light hangs at the intersection. Elder looks in the rear-view mirror and sees the green package.

The light changes. A car comes from the right as he steps on the throttle. He slams on the SQUEALING brakes as he CRASHES into the side of the car driven by Trema.

EXT. CITY STREET

A DUMB COP, with a droopy face resembling Bell’s Palsy, holds a driver’s license. He turns to look when he hears the crash. A WOMAN appears put out.

WOMAN

Honestly, officer. I wouldn’t have pulled over had I known you were just going to criticize me.

He FLIPS the ladies license through the open window.

DUMB COP

Keep it under a 100.

EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

Elder, pinned to the steering wheel, holds the green package. BYSTANDERS pull boxes off to free him; some run off with them. 

The dumb cop arrives and walks to Trema sitting in her car. 

DUMB COP

What happened?

Trema holds her neck as she points.

TREMA

That imbecile ran a red light. I couldn’t stop.

A bystander walks over.

BYSTANDER

I saw it all officer. Her car ran the red light, and the truck hit her.

The ambulance arrives, and paramedics put her in a neck brace.  

DUMB COP

Where’s the truck driver?

The bystander points.

BYSTANDER

Over there. It’s a miracle he wasn’t hurt.

Elder sits on the curb and stands as the dumb cop approaches.

DUMB COP

Let’s get your version. What happened?

Elder writes; shows the note. The dumb cop looks askance at the note.

DUMB COP (cont'd)

I need to see your license.

Elder shows his license from the Malibu Raceway Grand Prix.

The dumb cop looks at both sides of his license; makes some notes, and hands it back.

DUMB COP (cont'd)

Okay. You’ll need to file an accident report.

We see Archie drive up; get out of his car and walk up to the Elder.

ARCHIE

Christ all mighty. What have you done to my truck?

Elder writes.

ARCHIE (cont'd)

What the f...?

and with a faint smile hands the note to Archie.

ARCHIE (cont'd)

You’re fucking fired. Do you hear me?

(beat)

 You can fucking hear me, right?

Elder nods.

ARCHIE (cont'd)

You’re fucking fired!

Archie looks towards the truck and sees a boy picking up a box and running away.

ARCHIE (cont'd)

Hey! You! Get away from my stuff.

Archie runs after the boy.

INT. KARMINA’S BEDROOM

Karmina calls her boyfriend CHICO.

KARMINA

Chico? Are you coming?

CHICO (V.O.)

I got stuff to do in Miami.

KARMINA

You stupid? Forget Miami Chico. Tomorrow we will be rich. We will live in Beverly Hills. You will have all the cars you want. I will buy you a Ferrari.

CHICO (V.O.)

I always know one day I'm coming there; I got some business to take care of first. Manny, that cockroach, he ripped me off, and I’m gonna get what’s coming to me. 

KARMINA

Are you crazy? Forget Manny Chico. You’re just gonna get yourself killed with those Colombians. We gonna have it all tomorrow.

CHICO (V.O.)

Not if I kill the cockroaches first. Nobody disrespects me and lives to talk about it. I’ll take care of the business first then I come.

KARMINA

Chico, I have to tell you something. There is this woman - the general manager at the car store. She has disrespected you.

INT. CITY BUS - MORNING

Elder boards a bus. It’s standing room only. A man gets up and lets him sit. Elder places the package on his lap. 

A GIRL, in her early twenties in a summer dress, sits across from him.

Elder smiles and nods. A MAN and a OLD WOMAN can be seen talking.

WOMAN (V.O.)

I saw what you did. It was very kind to give that young man your seat.

MAN (V.O.)

I always give up my seat for the elderly or the handicapped. 



WOMAN (V.O.)

You are wonderful. I wish more men were like you.

MAN (V.O.)

But I will never again give up my seat for a blind man.

WOMAN (V.O.)

I don’t understand. Why?

The bus starts moving and ROARS as it picks up speed.

MAN (V.O.)

Why? Well, you see, I used to be a bus driver and....

INT./EXT CITY BUS

A woman with shopping bags waits at the bus stop. Her hair a messy beehive; her face covered by a vintage gas mask. 

The bus stops, and she boards. A BOY sitting next to Elder gets up and goes to the rear. 

The girl stares at the woman as she passes. 

GIRL

Space, the final frontier.

The woman sits down next to Elder. 

Elder writes on his notepad. Elder gets up and places the package on the seat.

He walks up to the driver and shows him the note. 

DRIVER

You’ll have to transfer.

The driver tears off a transfer ticket, and SLAMS on his brakes as two kids on bicycles pass in front of the bus.

Elder falls into the stairway. 

The driver gets up and helps him.

DRIVER (cont'd)

Those stupid kids. They’re lucky I’m not blind.  

We hear the REAR DOOR OPEN. 

Elder goes back to his seat and sits. He looks on the floor as the bus moves. 

We see that the lady and the girl are gone. The boy looks at him. 

BOY

They went out the back door.

Elder reaches up and pulls the cord. We hear a CHIME. 

Elder quickly writes; shows the note to the driver.

DRIVER

You’ll have to wait. Next stop is in three blocks.  

EXT. CITY STREET

Elder gets off the bus and runs back to the last stop. 

He looks around and doesn’t see people or his package. He sits down on a bench and puts his head in his hands. 

The girl walks up behind him.

GIRL

You should be more careful. 

He turns his head to see the girl. 

GIRL (cont'd)

I think this is yours. 

She hands him the damaged package.

She sits down. 

GIRL (cont'd)

Sorry, it got ripped up a bit. That weirdo wanted to fight me for it. She tried to kick me.

Elder writes; shows the note.

GIRL (cont'd)

You’re welcome. Now she knows that a gas mask doesn’t work against a right hook. And, I’m fine. 

Elder writes; shows the note.

GIRL (cont'd)

My dad taught me. He was a pro heavyweight. 

(beat)

I can get another bus later. You could buy me a cup of tea if you like.

INT./EXT. PIXIE KITCHEN

Elder stops at the front door. He appears to have second thoughts. 

GIRL

What’s wrong?

Elder shakes his head and opens the door.

They walk in, and he trips on a carpet and takes down a book kiosk and a donation box for the disabled. 

The girl laughs, and several employee’s giggle. 

GIRL (cont'd)

Sorry. You’re on a roll today dude. It’s like that carpet just came up to get you.

A waitress rushes over to clean up the mess. 

They sit down in a booth. The girl looks up to the waitress.

The waitress and Elder stare daggers at each other.

GIRL (cont'd)

I don’t know what he wants. I’d like Jasmine tea.

Elder shakes his head. 

We see a charm bracelet on Jackie. There are two glass slippers on a silver chain.

GIRL (cont'd)

I’m Jackie. If you don’t mind me asking. What did I risk my life for?

Elder writes; shows the note.

JACKIE

I’m a little confused Elder. What do your parents have to do with the package?

Elder points to the package and moves his lips - my parents.

JACKIE (cont'd)

(thinking)

Oh crap! I was carrying around your parent’s dust. How cool is that?

(beat)

Dude, you are a little weird. 

Embarrassed, he writes quickly; shows the note. 

JACKIE (cont'd)

How could they screw that up? 

She looks at the package.

JACKIE (cont'd)

The address looks clear to me.

Elder writes; shows the note. Jackie looks confused.

JACKIE (cont'd)

(sarcastic tone)

Oh. Fairy Falls... in Oregon. Oh, yeah. Right. What was I thinking?

Elder writes; shows the note, and points to his throat.

JACKIE (cont'd)

Did the doctor say when you would get it back?

Elder writes; shows the note.

JACKIE (cont'd)

Well, you could try to get a job selling cars. My aunt says that they train you, but you have to sell your soul. 

Elder writes; shows the note.

JACKIE (cont'd)

I don’t think she really means it. But, there's this place off the highway next to the cemetery. 

Elder writes; shows the note. 

JACKIE (cont'd)

The billboard with the bimbo on the beach under the umbrella - Home of the Shady Deal or something like that.

JACKIE (cont'd)

I’ll give you the address. But my aunt says it’s a rats nest.

Jackie looks at her cell phone.

JACKIE (cont'd)

Her firm made the will for the owner who is dead now. Used to be a good place to buy a car before he died. Now his daughter has it.

Elder writes; shows the note.

JACKIE (cont'd)

Her and my mother don’t get on that well. My aunt has ethics. Seems strange for a lawyer doesn’t it.

Elder writes; shows the note.

JACKIE (cont'd)

I appreciate that you can’t lie or be dishonest, but maybe selling cars there will be okay.

(beat)

Sorry, I’m talking too much. What about you? 

Elder writes; shows the note.

JACKIE (cont'd)

I get it. Family is close, but don’t really know you. Caught up in their own shit as my dad would say. 

Elder writes; shows the note.

JACKIE (cont'd)

My aunt would advise against being a lawyer. Would you defend murderers and rapists or wives who kill their husbands in self-defense? 

Elder writes; shows the note.

JACKIE (cont'd)

(droll tone)

Employment and Labor Law. Sounds too exciting. 

The tab comes to the table. Elder throws cash at it.

JACKIE (cont'd)

You could specialize in accidents and personal injury since you have the experience.

They laugh (Elder fakes it).

EXT. PIXIE KITCHEN - DAY

Elder stands outside of the restaurant. He takes out his cell phone and TEXTS Vidia.

ELDER

Big screw-up with the shipping company. Mother and father are with me. 

VIDIA

What? How did you take the package back?

ELDER

I’ll tell you later. Got to find another job today. I’m at the Pixie Kitchen. 

VIDIA

Are you crazy? Get out of there. What happened to your job? Wait for me. I will take the package. 

ELDER

Don’t tell Godmother that I screwed up. She already hates me.

VIDIA

No, she loves you (sad emoticon).

ELDER

I met this girl (happy emoticon) 

EXT. SKIPPY’S BEDROOM

The Venetian blinds are partially closed, and beams of light stripe the wall. 

We see a large spider lowering itself inch by inch on a perilous length of thread until it becomes transfixed in the path of the sunbeam.

Cages of big spiders line the walls; some three cages tall.

8x10-inch yearbook pictures of high school girls cover the walls. 

Skippy takes a spider from a cage and puts it against a picture.

SKIPPY

(creepy tone)

Do you want go to the prom Sheila?

The spider crawls across the picture.

SKIPPY (cont'd)

Oh, you’re not. Why’s that Sheila? Do you want to go to a movie? My dad will give me his car.

(long beat)

Oh, I understand. Maybe another time.

The spider walks off the picture; he pets it and puts it back on the picture.

SKIPPY (cont'd)

(to spider)

You are my best climber. 

SKIPPY (cont'd)

Did you have fun with David at the prom Sheila?

FLASHBACK: INT. SCHOOL GYM - NIGHT

A younger Skippy stands against a wall with some other boys. He wears his signature bow tie and strains his eyes as he looks at Sheila and David dancing. 

The slow sad sound of blues permeates the room, and we see couples dancing close; some are kissing.

A group of girls’ giggle near a wall on the far side of the gym. A younger Ana breaks from the group and walks over to Skippy. She carries a large shoulder purse.

ANA

(a younger Ana)

Do you want to dance?

They walk out onto the dance floor. The groups of boys and girls talk and smirk.

Skippy turns his head to look at Sheila.

ANA (cont'd)

Why are you looking at her?

SKIPPY

Sorry, I don’t like her.

Skippy tries not to look.

ANA

My name is Ana.

SKIPPY

I know.

Ana steps on his toes. Skippy reacts.

ANA

I’m sorry. I think my shoes are too big.

SKIPPY

It’s okay. I don’t dance very well.

ANA

Why don’t you like her?

SKIPPY

I don’t know. She’s okay, I guess.

Ana looks at David.

ANA

I don’t like him. He always avoids me in the halls like I have some kind of disease.

Skippy looks at David.

SKIPPY

Yeah. He thinks he’s pretty cool. He doesn’t talk to me neither.

Ana leads her and Skippy closer to Sheila and David.

We see them dancing next to Sheila and David. Ana reaches into her purse and pulls out a Tarantula.

Skippy’s head and chest retreat, but he continues to hold Ana. 

Ana nonchalantly places the spider on David’s back, and she leads Skippy away from the couple.

Sheila’s face changes expression. She removes her hand from David’s back, and we see the spider on the back of her hand. She SCREAMS.

FLASH FORWARD: EXT. PETCO - ESTABLISHING - DAY

Typical parking lot with a few cars parked.

INT. PETCO

Skippy peers at cages of spiders as a CLERK approaches him.

CLERK

Can I help you find something?

SKIPPY

I’m looking for a special spider.

CLERK

What do you mean by special?

SKIPPY

I mean really big and scary. These are too small.

CLERK

Well, we have one, but we’re supposed to send it back to our distributor.

SKIPPY

What’s wrong with it?

CLERK

Nothing, but it scares the hell out of the customers. It’s really big.

SKIPPY

Show it to me?

CLERK

Follow me.

They go into the back room.

CLERK (cont'd)

There, in the box. You can look. I’m not getting close to it.

Skippy opens the shallow box. His face lights up. The spider is big and hairy.

SKIPPY

Perfect. Do you gift wrap?

EXT. COFFEE SHOP - ESTABLISHING - DAY

We see a coffee shop in the strip mall near Petco.

INT. COFFEE SHOP

The coffee shop has a side room with a few tables. 

Skippy walks into the room with apple juice and sits down at a table. He stares at Vidia seated at another table. 

Skippy takes a drink; looks around; gets up and walks over to Vidia.

CAMERA POV - SKIPPY’S BACK/VIDIA

He flashes the lid to open the box containing the spider.

Vidia, a shocked look on her face, changes her expression to glee.

VIDIA

Oh! It’s big and so beautiful. Can I hold it?

Skippy, stunned, closes the box, and runs from the coffee shop.

EXT. CAR DEALER - ESTABLISHING - DAY

We see a sign at the entrance. S&M Motors. 

A billboard near the entrance displays a girl dressed in a bikini under an umbrella on a tropical beach. The caption reads: S&M Motors - Home of the Shady Deal.

EXT. CAR DEALER - LOT

Elder, looks at a car near a cyclone fence. We see a cemetery though the fence - headstones just feet from some cars.

A mouse runs through the fence from the cemetery and passes between his feet.

LOLA, an elderly greeter, wearing glasses and a hearing aid, shuffles up to him. 

LOLA

(voice breaks)

Welcome to S&M Motors. I’m Lola, the greeter. How can I help you?

Elder writes; shows the note. She extends her arms to read.

LOLA (cont'd)

I’ll send out someone.

EXT. CAR DEALER - LOT - DAY

STEVE, a young salesman approaches Elder.

STEVE

She’s a beauty. Only had her a few days. Won’t last. 

The salesman opens the door for him. Elder sits down and places his hands on the wheel.

STEVE (cont'd)

I see you like this one. Smells like new, doesn’t it? 

Elder gets up from the car seat and walks around to the back of the car. The salesman opens the trunk.

STEVE (cont'd)

It’s got a huge trunk. You can take the whole family on a vacation. Room for everything.

(long beat)

Doesn’t look big enough for you? Go ahead; get in and crawl around. You’ll see.

Elder looks at him questionably.

STEVE (cont'd)

It’s okay. Everybody needs to do this. You don’t want to buy a car that doesn’t fit. Right?

Elder gets into the trunk and the salesman lowers the lid until it almost closes.

STEVE (cont'd)

See? What did I tell you. Huge! And we finance anyone the law allows.

Salesman opens the lid and Elder gets out.

STEVE (cont'd)

And, here’s the great part. It’s on sale. Only $19,995. It’s a steal at that price. Let’s drive it.

Elder writes; shows the note.

STEVE (cont'd)

Wait a minute. I’ve got an idea.

INT. CAR DEALER - SALES OFFICE

Steve approaches as she looks at lottery tickets.  

STEVE

I got this guy who doesn’t have a job and won’t drive the car. 

 puts the lottery tickets into her pocket.



Never believe the customer. Buyers are liars. Get me the keys. 

EXT. CAR DEALER - LOT

 extends her hand to Elder.



I’m Brevil, sales manager. Hear that you like this car.

Elder writes; shows the note.

INT./EXT. CAR DEALER - SHOWROOM

Elder follows into the showroom. 

CLOSE UP ON PICTURE OF SAM

the deceased owner of S&M Motors.



Have a seat. Ever sold cars? 

Elder writes; shows the note.

 (cont'd)

I can guarantee you $2000 a month. But you have to sell cars. You’ll make more; a lot more. We’ll help you.

Elder’s eyes get big with excitement.

He writes; shows the note.

 (cont'd)

No. Who told you that? You don’t have to cheat or lie to anyone. We’ll take of that, or rather I mean that we will care of everything.

(beat)

Do we have a deal?

They shake hands and Brevil gets up and goes into the sales office. 

Elder takes out his sanitizer; wipes his hands and pops a pill. 

Brevil comes back to the table with a packet of forms.

 (cont'd)

Here, get started. I’ll be back.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

Archie takes a package onto the porch, and RINGS the doorbell. 

A dog BARKS and Ana HOLLERS from inside.

ANA

I can’t come just yet. Set it by the door.

Archie steps off the porch and looks into a big window. The dog goes jumping-crazy on the curtains shredding them. 

Archie runs to his truck.

Ana tries in vain to open the storm door against the package that is wedged between the door and the porch railing.

ANA (cont'd)

Shit!

Ana comes from the back of the house and picks up the package on the porch and enters the house.

INT. ANA’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Ana opens the package and pulls out a wedding dress and a big pair of shoes.

She puts on the dress and shoes in front of the mirror. The mirror weeps.

INT. LAW OFFICE - LOBBY - DAY

PRISCILLA faces her boss CHUCK who appears rushed.

CHUCK

Today is the last day before we execute Sam’s will. So, you should run out there and check things out before tomorrow. 

PRISCILLA

Right. About my hours Chuck. I’ve been here for two years working about 60 hours a week...

CHUCK

(cuts her off)

We’ve talked about this before. It’s not entirely my decision. I have a meeting across town and have to get going. Let’s talk next week. 

PRISCILLA

I’m taking a vacation next week.

CHUCK

Just take care of Sam’s estate tomorrow.

Chuck walks out as Jackie walks in the front door.

PRISCILLA

I’m about ready.

JACKIE

I met this really nice guy today. I think he’s perfect for me.

PRISCILLA

Really. What makes you think he would be perfect? Trust me, there are no perfect men.

JACKIE

Just a strong sense about him. He’s smart and caring, but he’s a little absent minded in a funny way. 

PRISCILLA

Where am I taking you today?

JACKIE

Just drop me off at the mall.

PRISCILLA

I hope he’s smarter than one of the clients I recently represented.

FLASHBACK: INT. COURTROOM - DAY

We see an upset plaintiff seated next to her attorney. She is about to cry.

In the witness chair the defendant appears arrogant. 

PRISCILLA

So, Mr. Jackson, where were you on the night in question.

DEFENDANT

I was in my crib watching TV.

PRISCILLA

What were you watching?

DEFENDANT

NBA.

PRISCILLA

Who was playing?

DEFENDANT

The Bulls and the Blazers.

The plaintiff’s attorney stands up.

ATTORNEY

Objection your honor. Where is this going?

JUDGE

Well, Miss Marple, where are you going with this line of questioning?

PRISCILLA

I’m just trying to prove that my client was at home watching TV and couldn’t have been at the scene of the crime.

JUDGE

Do you have any witnesses?

PRISCILLA

His mother your honor.

JUDGE

Of course, objection sustained. Continue Miss Marple.

PRISCILLA

I’m done with my client your honor.

JUDGE

Mr. Barrister?

MR. BARRISTER

I have some questions your honor.

The plaintiff’s attorney approaches the witness.

MR. BARRISTER (cont'd)

Mr. Jackson. You have said that you were home watching TV with your mother on the night of the assault.

DEFENDANT

Yeah.

MR. BARRISTER

Who won the game?

DEFENDANT

(unsure)

Maybe the bulls.

MR. BARRISTER

So, you left before the game ended and met your friends and assaulted my client?

PRISCILLA

Objection your honor. Asked and answered.

JUDGE

Objection sustained.

The plaintiff, visibly upset, gets up and points at him.

PLAINTIFF

(yelling)

He’s one of the four men who attacked me.

DEFENDANT

(jumps to his feet)

She’s lying. There was only three of us. The stupid lady can’t even count.

INT. CAR DEALER - SHOWROOM - DAY

 walks over to a table with Steve and an angry customer. She extends her hand to the LADY, but the lady shuns her.

LADY

You tricked me.



What do you mean?

LADY

The SUV you sold me is not all wheel drive. The salesman told me it was.



How do you know it’s not all wheel drive?

LADY

There’s no label that says it is.



Well, sometimes it doesn’t have a label.

LADY

It had a label on the back when I bought it.



Maybe it fell off. But we’ll take care of it. Give me your keys.

 takes her keys; gets up and signals for Steve to follow her.

 (cont'd)

What a cock up, go to parts and get a label; take the car around back to Jimmy and have him put it on. What did you tell her when she bought it?

STEVE

That it had all wheel drive.



Does it?

STEVE

I don’t know. I thought it did.



Not all SUVs have all wheel drive. Anyway, get the label and get her out of here. She’s hurting business.

EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

Vidia comes out of the coffee shop. She gets in and drives off.

Skippy follows her.

INT./EXT. DAYCARE - DAY

Vidia gets out of her car and goes into the daycare with the package. Skippy parks his car and waits.

Vidia walks into her classroom. The CHILDREN all SCREAM with joy. A substitute walks out.

VIDIA

So, today I’m going to tell you the story about why the fairies, pixies, and all the other creatures of the fantasy world took the human form.

The children quiet down.

VIDIA (cont'd)

To become human, fairies had to give up some of their powers, such as bestowing wealth, kindness, and intelligence.

LITTLE SARAH

Why did they want to become human?

VIDIA

So they could live in the real world and feel human emotions.

Little Johnny sits at the back of class with his arms folded.

LITTLE JOHNNY

What about Santa?

VIDIA

Santa is a story best told to you by your parents.

LITTLE JOHNNY

My parents are divorced.

LITTLE SARAH

What about Cinderella? Is she a human?

VIDIA

Many girls think she is. They want to be just like her and have a fairy tale wedding and live happily ever after.

All the little girls smile.

LITTLE JOHNNY

My father says that’s bull. He says that instead of getting married again, he’s going to find a woman he doesn’t like and just give her a house.

All the girls look at Little Johnny

(beat)

VIDIA

Yes, so...

LITTLE SARAH

What’s in the green box? It looks like a present.

VIDIA

Well, it is kind of. It’s fairy dust.

All the children ooh and aah except Little Johnny.

VIDIA (cont'd)

Each speck of dust has the power to change your life.

LITTLE SARAH

Like magic?

VIDIA

Exactly. Each speck of dust is a very small piece of magic. When a fairy uses it for good it helps people.

LITTLE SARAH

Can we see some?

VIDIA

I would show you, but it is wrapped up, and we can’t look at someone’s present until they open it can we?

CHILDREN

(in unison)

No.

LITTLE SARAH

At Sunday school our teacher said that without God, we are but dust. What is butt dust?

LITTLE JOHNNY

My mother says that’s the dust that protects the furniture.

INT./EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

Vidia gets in her car; unwraps the package and throws the paper and box on the floorboard. She puts the urn in the center console. 

She drives away, and Skippy follows her.

EXT. PARKING LOT

She drives into a parking space; gets out and walks towards the occult shop.

EXT. OCCULT SHOP - ESTABLISHING - DAY

The shop has a sign in the window - URBAN LEGENDS - Lecture Today.

INT. OCCULT SHOP - DAY

The shop, dimly lit, looks like it doesn’t see a lot of business. Ouija boards laden with dust; items used and in need of repair lay on the shelves and floor. The only natural light is coming from a glass door to the front of the shop.

Vidia stands behind a customer. 

The owner, DWARF #1, is showing a trick to a CUSTOMER. 

CUSTOMER

How did you do that? 

DWARF #1

I would tell you sir, but then I would have to remove your tongue. 

CUSTOMER

I’ll be right back. My wife is in the car. You can tell her.

The man leaves, and Vidia walks to the counter.

VIDIA

My Godmother sent me to pick up her wand.

DWARF #1

Do you have a claim ticket?

Vidia shows the ticket.

VIDIA

Here it is.

The ticket sparkles. Dwarf #1 takes the ticket and goes into the back room.

We see an old Japanese doll high on a shelf behind the counter. With eyes closed it looks dead.

Dwarf #1 returns with the wand in a box.

DWARF #1

I put on a new coat of lacquer and uploaded the latest shielding technologies. She shouldn’t have any more problems. 

VIDIA

What was wrong with it. 

DWARF #1

It had the Trump virus. It happens with older wands. At two in the morning, it had to go tweet.

EXT. PARKING LOT

Skippy gets out of his car and walks to her car and slides a metal rod inside the door. It unlocks. 

We look into the glove box and see a neat and orderly placement of objects. Skippy rifles through the contents; takes out her registration and makes a note. An object falls to the floor.

He looks in the center console; also, neat and orderly. He sees the urn and takes it.

INT. OCCULT SHOP

We hear a VOICE from a side room. Vidia walks through a curtain into the room.

We see a LECTURER sitting on a stool in a darkened room in front of a dozen people.

LECTURER

The story is true. You must ensure that the doll has been exorcised before you bring it into your home. 

LISTENER #1

But that legend is from the far east. We don’t have that legend here.

LECTURER

Believe or don’t believe. Never give a doll to a child until you know it is free of the Hachishakusama. If the doll is possessed, the spirit lays in wait for the child to sleep and dream. 

LISTENER #2

How can you really know that the spirit is gone? What if the exorcism isn’t done properly?



LECTURER

Then the Hachishakusama enters their dreams and fills them with such horror that if they were to awake, they would scream until their little hearts stopped. 

LISTENER #1

They never awake?

LECTURER

And they usually die in their beds a few days later.

Silence settles into the room.

LECTURER (cont'd)

I remember a case where the child did not dream, because she was pure in spirit and protected by the fairies.

LISTENER #1

So, the Hachishakusama couldn’t possess the child?

LECTURER

That’s right. It was trapped in the doll until many years later when the doll was sold to a foreigner.

LISTENER #2

What happened? 

LECTURER

It’s not known. But I assume some unlucky child became its victim.

LISTENER #2

I can see how the doll could travel and end up with an unsuspecting child.

LISTENER #1

I bet the Hachishakusama had a lot of pent-up energy having to reside in the doll for all those years. 

LECTURER

And, it doesn’t just prey on children. Anyone who possesses the doll is fair game. 

LISTENER #2

Only mortals who have evil in their hearts will see the Hachishakusama in their final breaths. Mythical beings can see her anytime. 

LISTENER #1

What does Hachishakusama look like?

LECTURER

Some say that she is very tall with long black hair; black pearl eyes, and a white gown. Those who related this description died within days.

EXT. CITY STREET

Vidia parks her car in front of a cemetery. GODMOTHER sits on a discarded chair in a hooded robe. Dressed like the fairy godmother in Cinderella this woman looks like a tough old broad who doesn’t take shit from anyone. 

Vidia hands her the box that contains the wand.

GODMOTHER

I would give you something in return, but my gift shop is a little low on inventory. 

She looks over her shoulder to a shopping cart covered in a tarp. 

GODMOTHER (cont'd)

Thank you dear. I assume Dee put it on my account. Are you ready to commit your parents to our cause?

VIDIA

Not yet. 

(beat)

We got an eviction notice this morning. I don’t know what we are going to do. Elder is out looking for a job today.

GODMOTHER

Good. It’s time he learned how to take care of himself. 

VIDIA

He’s trying. Can’t you wave your wand or something and get us an apartment?

GODMOTHER

(looking over her shoulder into the cemetery)

If that worked, do you think I would be sleeping in a crypt? 

EXT. CEMETERY - CRYPT - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

The trees look down on the rows of graves like phantasm guardians of the underworld. 

We see a walk-in crypt with a heavy metal ornamental door.

FLASHBACK: INT. CEMETERY - CRYPT - NIGHT

Godmother and Vidia walk down the marble stairs to the chamber floor. A fan CIRCULATES in a marble wall leading to the outside. 

We hear MOANS. Godmother looks up to the fan.

GODMOTHER

The dead are active and move beneath the trees while the living have not substance.

A lab setup - glass containers, pipettes, Bunsen burners, etc., rest on a slab to the side of the cold room. 

Godmother mixes chemicals. From a jeweled urn, she adds a few particles of FAIRY DUST to a container and gently stirs.

GODMOTHER (cont'd)

It’s a blessing that the Stone family willed me the key to their crypt. I now have a place to conduct my experiments.

We see candles throughout. The lights flicker.

GODMOTHER (cont'd)

The power is provided by the cemetery - part of their endowment, but the wiring is in need of repair.

We see a bed made of an exquisite quilt and satin pillow on a pew to the side of the room. 

VIDIA

What are you doing?

GODMOTHER

Working on a formula to instill honesty and goodwill. The dust is the magic ingredient, but I need more. Here, taste this.

She hands her a glass of a SPARKLING SUBSTANCE resembling champagne.

VIDIA

(sneezes)

I think it needs some more Sarsi. And, I would cut back on the carbonation.

(beat)

What are you going to do with it?

GODMOTHER

Bottle it and give it to Congress, but we may have to send in the Marines to make them drink it.

EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

Godmother looks at Skippy’s car.

GODMOTHER

There’s a man in a car over there looking at us. Do you know him?

Vidia looks at the car.

VIDIA

I think it’s the man from the coffee shop. He flashed his spider at me. What’s he doing here?

Skippy sees them looking at him and drives away.

GODMOTHER

I’ve seen him before. He works at the car dealer next door. 

VIDIA

I have to get back to work.

INT./EXT. VIDIA’S CAR - DAY

Vidia parks in front of the daycare. 

She looks in the center consul and discovers the missing urn. We see a disbelieving look that turns to panic.

She opens the glove box and sees that it is messy.

She dials 911.

The sheriff arrives in the K-9 car. He steps out of the car and approaches Vidia standing at the passenger side of her car. She is crying.

SHERIFF

What happened?

VIDIA

My parents are gone. He stole my parents.

She sobs.

SHERIFF

Tell me what happened?

VIDIA

I came out of the coffee shop and put the package in the car. I took the urn out of the package and put it in the center console.

SHERIFF

Got it. Describe this man.

VIDIA

When I was in the coffee shop he came over and showed me his spider. He wanted to look at my package.

SHERIFF

What did this pervert look like?

VIDIA

He had a bow tie. And, his hair was really short.

SHERIFF

Not a lot of bow ties in LA. Was his hair like mine?

VIDIA

(uses her thumb and fore finger)

No. It was sticking up this much on top. And, he wore glasses.

SHERIFF

Crew cut. Did you see his car?

VIDIA

Not then. He was gone when I came out. But I think he followed me here.

SHERIFF

Can you describe the urn?

VIDIA

It’s about six inches tall. Maybe four inches wide. And, it’s inlaid with gold and jewels.

(beat)

And it’s sealed. No one can open it.

SHERIFF

Don’t quite understand. It can’t be opened? Is it like glued shut?

VIDIA

Yes, something like that. So, I don’t have to worry about their dust being removed. Only our family has the means to open it.

The sheriff goes to his car and lets his dog out.

SHERIFF

BRUNO. Come boy.

Bruno, a big police dog, gets out and paces anxiously. Gentle as a pussycat when out of enforcement character, he is an overwhelming force in attack mode. They walk back to Vidia. Bruno stops and wags his tail.

Vidia stops sobbing.

VIDIA

He is so beautiful.

He opens her door and Bruno sniffs at the wrappings on the floor.

SHERIFF

Okay. You’re going to have to file a report.

(beat)

We met earlier today.

VIDIA

Yes. I remember.

SHERIFF

I’ll need your phone number...

(beat)

in case something develops before you get your report filed.

Vidia writes on his pad.

SHERIFF (cont'd)

I can’t imagine how you feel. We’ll do our best to find your parents.

(beat)

Won’t we Bruno?

BRUNO

BARKS.

Their eyes meet; we see the attraction.

INT. CAR DEALER - SALES OFFICE - DAY

 goes into her office and picks up the phone. We hear a PAGE.



Ana, sales office.

ANA comes into the sales office. 

ANA

Yeah sis.



New guy starting. He can’t talk, so you’ll need to work with that. 

FLASHBACK: INT. APARTMENT KITCHEN - NIGHT

A much younger Elder open a box of cereal and spills it on the floor. He kicks it under the table and walks away.

Godmother walks in and sees the mess.

GODMOTHER

Elder!

BEDROOM

We see Elder in the mess he calls his bedroom. Pictures of cars cover the walls. His attention? A road racing game on his computer.

Godmother walks in.

GODMOTHER

You left a mess in the kitchen. Why didn’t you clean it up?

ELDER

Maybe Vidia did it.

GODMOTHER

Vidia would never leave a mess. You’ll clean it up now. 

ELDER

Vidia can do it when she gets back if you’re in a hurry.

Godmother squeezes her eyes.

GODMOTHER

It’s not her job to manage the kitchen.  

ELDER

(obstinate)

It’s a woman’s job to manage the kitchen.

As if drawing a gun from its holster, Godmother draws her wand from her waistband.

GODMOTHER

And what do you think is your job?

ELDER

I don’t have a job. 

GODMOTHER

Exactly. 

ELDER

I’m too busy to manage a job.

GODMOTHER

Elder, I shouldn’t have to remind you of the Fairy Code. We have a responsibility to take care of others, and that includes your sister. And, we never lie.

ELDER

I manage to meet girls online and at the mall. That’s my job.



GODMOTHER

I don’t like your tone. Stand up and look at me.

Elder turns to get up and sees the wand. His eyes grow big with fear.

She smacks his throat with the wand.

GODMOTHER (cont'd)

Let’s see how you manage now.

(beat)

Start to think of others; not just yourself.

INT. CAR DEALER - SHOWROOM - DAY

Ana sits down with Elder; taking his paperwork.

ANA

(coolly)

I’m Ana. Looks like you’re done. Let’s go outside and chat. 

EXT. CAR DEALER - LOT

They stand outside the showroom in the hot sun. She puts on her sunglasses and looks at his notepad.

ANA

(coolly)

When someone drives in you ask them what they are looking for. Then, you show them a car and make them drive it. Understand? 

Elder nods.

ANA (cont'd)

Get familiar with the cars. Don’t let them leave without talking to me.

Elder writes; shows the note.

ANA (cont'd)

What? Next you’ll want a day off and a demo. Sell a car and maybe we’ll talk about it.

INT. CAR DEALER - MEETING ROOM

Ana speaks to a small group of her salespeople. 

ANA

You guys aren’t selling. So, you’re going to turn everybody.

SALESMAN

What if everyone is busy?

ANA

Then you turn them to me.

SALESMAN

What if you are busy?

ANA

Nobody walks out of here without talking to another salesman, or me. Turn, turn, and turn until you get them inside. I’ll do the rest. 

SALESMAN

What if we don’t have the car they want?

ANA

(to anyone)

What do you say to them when you know we don’t have the car?

STEVE

Wait here. I’ve got an idea.

ANA

Or, I think I have that exact car on our other lot. Wait here. And turn’em.

SALESMAN

Do we have another lot?

ANA

No, we don’t have another lot, but they don’t know that. Buyers don’t know what they want until they see it. Tell lies to keep them here.

STEVE

Can we tell big lies?

ANA

I really don’t care what you tell them as long as it leads to a sale.  

(beat)

Everybody drives. If you can’t get them to drive the car then what do you do?

SALESMAN

Wait here. I’ve got an idea and turn’em. 

ANA

The smell of the wheel seals the deal.

EXT. CAR DEALER - LOT

A salesman walks over to Elder.

SALESMAN

I need to turn this lady. She doesn’t want to drive the car. Follow me. 

We see MRS. CLARK, an older woman in a choir gown.

SALESMAN (cont'd)

Mrs. Clark, this is Newbie. He will take good care of you.

Elder writes; shows the note and smiles.

MRS. CLARK

I hope you are not pushy. That other salesman was too pushy.

Elder writes; shows the note and smiles.

MRS. CLARK (cont'd)

It’s a nice car, but I don’t think I can drive it now.

Elder writes; shows the note and smiles.

MRS. CLARK (cont'd)

Thank you. I know I would like you.

(long beat)

Maybe I should hear it run.

Elder writes; shows the note and smiles.

MRS. CLARK (cont'd)

Okay. I’ll wait for you.

Elder comes back with the keys. 

The car points towards the showroom. Mrs. Clark gets in and closes the door; her gown drapes on the pavement. 

Elder gets in the passenger side.

INT./EXT. CAR DEALER - LOT

She looks at the upholstery.

MRS. CLARK

Oh. It’s beautiful. But my seat isn’t right.

He gets out; opens her door and adjusts the seat and steering wheel. 

We see two pedals near the firewall: a clutch next to the brake. The gear shifter is in first. 

MRS. CLARK (cont'd)

Oh. This is much better. Thank you. Could I hear the motor?

Elder reaches over to fasten her seat belt.

MRS. CLARK (cont'd)

I still don’t think I want to drive. We’ll just sit here and listen to the motor.

Elder hands her the keys and walks to the other side. 

The car abruptly starts; MOTOR REVS at a high pitch; and lunges forward. Mrs. Clark SCREAMS.

INT./EXT. CAR DEALER - SHOWROOM

Ana sits with a frazzled Mrs. Clark as an ambulance pulls up. 

Trema, her neck rigid in a brace, arrives in a taxi. Slow as a turtle in a hare race she gets out. She holds a cat carrier and walks towards the showroom door. 

Elder comes up from behind and opens the door for her.  Her black cat, Lucy, growls at Elder. 

INT. CAR DEALER - SALES OFFICE

Trema walks into the sales office.  sits at her desk.



(aghast)

Mother, what happened to you?

TREMA

I got hit by a truck. Why is the ambulance here?



We got hit too. Lady didn’t know how to drive with a clutch. Two cars damaged. 

TREMA

Great! It must be my lucky day - only two accidents. If I ever see that guy again, I will rip the heart from his chest and feed it to Lucy.

Trema lets Lucy out of her cage. Lucy GROWLS.

TREMA (cont'd)

There you go my sweetie.

(beat)

Go kill a mouse.

Lucy runs out of the office.

TREMA (cont'd)

I need another car. Make it a convertible this time. I can be seen easier.

(beat)

I’ve a doctor’s appointment, so I need it now. And, have the lot boy check it for mice.



I hired a new guy.

TREMA

Call the cemetery. Tell them we will sue unless they keep the mice on their side of the fence.

We hear a PAGE.



Jimmy, sales office.

TREMA

Good. We need more salesmen.



Ana wants to fire him already. He asked her for a draw. Thinks he’s a fairy.

TREMA

Still phobic, is she?



Well, it was traumatizing for her.

TREMA

I put her tooth under the pillow. She should have gotten money.

FLASHBACK: INT. GIRL’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

We see Cinderella collectibles - the prince, a palace dollhouse, and dolls in beautiful clothes. 

Cinderella is laying on a miniature table; her head in a guillotine.

The Prince figurine daunts over the wicked stepsisters; a glass slipper in his hands.

Ana sleeps. A front tooth obviously missing. 

Trema walks into the bedroom quietly and takes the tooth from under her pillow and puts some coins in its place.

, awake in her bed, has one eye open.

Trema leaves, and gets up and walks to Ana’s bed.

She takes the money and puts something under the pillow.

GIRL’S BEDROOM - MORNING

The room fills with light from the drawn shades.  sits on her bed.



Ana. Ana. Wake up.

Ana wakes up.

 (cont'd)

Did the tooth fairy come?

Ana turns over her pillow. We see a toad and hear a SCREAM.

INT. CAR DEALER - SALES OFFICE

 displays a devious smirk.

TREMA

Watch Lucy. I’ll be back.

INT./EXT. CAR DEALER - LOT

Elder greets a couple looking at a sports car. The HUSBAND sits behind the wheel. His WIFE stands with her arms folded.

WIFE

We came here to buy a van for the family. Why are you looking at this?

HUSBAND

Let me look will ya?

WIFE

We’re not buying you another sports car. 

She looks at Elder.

WIFE (cont'd)

We need something that fits four car seats and won’t explode when I bump into things.

The man looks at Elder.

MAN

You got the keys?

Elder nods; turns, and heads back towards the showroom.

WIFE

You’re not really going to drive this are you?

HUSBAND

Why not? We’re here.

WIFE

Just like last time. Give me our keys. I’m going back to the car.

The husband flips her the keys and the wife storms off.

Elder returns.

HUSBAND

She doesn’t know what she’s talking about. We can get four car seats in here. Lots of room.

Elder motions for him to get out of the car. The man gets out and follows Elder to the trunk. 

Elder opens the trunk and motions for him to get in.

HUSBAND (cont'd)

Yeah, that might be a little small.

Elder motions again; writes and shows the note.

HUSBAND (cont'd)

Are you sure? It doesn’t look that big.

The husband gets in and Elder lowers the lid and drops the keys inside as the lid closes. He pulls up on the lid while the man HOLLERS, but it doesn’t budge.

INT. CAR DEALER - SALES OFFICE

A lot boy stands by a desk.  gives him a packet and some keys.



We’ve got a dealer trade. I need for you to run up to Santa Barbara and get me a car.

EXT. CAR DEALER - LOT

The lot boy wears earplugs and listens to MUSIC as he jumps into the car with the husband in the trunk. 

We see the car drive off as Elder walks onto the lot.

EXT. CAR DEALER - LOT

Elder walks up to JABEN, a friendly salesman.

JABEN

Ana’s been looking for you. Better watch your back. She doesn’t like you.

Elder writes; shows the note.

JABEN (cont'd)

Accidents don’t matter with her. You’re looking to get fired on your first day.

Elder writes; shows the note.

JABEN (cont'd)

Sell something. Maybe you’ll get lucky and sell Karmina when she comes in. Then all will be forgiven.

Elder writes; shows the note.

JABEN (cont'd)

She comes in here every month like clockwork. Everyone has sold her a car, but she never takes delivery.

Elder writes; shows the note.

JABEN (cont'd)

Why? Who knows. Management says we have to get her delivered, but she’s a big waste of time and a real bitch.

Elder writes; shows the note.

JABEN (cont'd)

(looks over his shoulder at Lola)

Lola? Sam gave her grandmother rights. I heard that she used to be his girlfriend before Karmina entered the picture. Now, she's the greeter.

Elder writes; shows the note.

JABEN (cont'd)

Lola just gets in the way, but Karmina is another story. Let’s hope you don’t have to deal with Karmina.

We see Godmother walk towards the cemetery fence. Jaben points to her.

JABEN (cont'd)

That nice old lady walks through here every day. I think she lives in the cemetery. Comes here for water and snacks from the machine. 

Elder writes; shows the note.

JABEN (cont'd)

Yeah, no gate. No one knows how she gets through the fence. Every time I’ve watched her, I blink, and the next thing I see is her on the other side.

We hear a PAGE.



Jaben to the sales office.

JABEN

Haven’t sold a car in a month. I think I’m going to get fired. 

EXT. CAR DEALER - LOT - DAY

A salesman walks up to Elder. Elder turns away from Godmother.

SALESMAN

I need a turn. She won’t work with me. 

They walk to the TINA, a cougar, dressed in fire red. In black and white she would look like Cruella DeVil.

SALESMAN (cont'd)

TINA. This is Elder. He wants to help you.

TINA

Well, hello. You are handsome.

Elder writes; shows the note. 

TINA (cont'd)

A man who doesn’t talk. I like you already. I’m looking for a convertible.

Elder motions for her to follow him, and she grabs his arm. They stop at a convertible.

TINA (cont'd)

I want to drive this one.

Elder writes; shows the note and walks away.

He comes back with the keys. Tina sits in the passenger seat. 

TINA (cont'd)

You drive. The man always drives a lady.

They drive out of the dealership, and he crosses the center line just missing a head on collision with Archie's Parcel Service. 

ARCHIE (O.C.)

(yelling)

You fucking moron.

We hear HONKING and see Archie behind the wheel.

TINA

Drive to Beverly Hills. I want to show Phil this car.

They drive into Beverly Hills to a gated residence. It opens as Tina presses her remote. They stop at the front door.

TINA (cont'd)

Come on in and meet Phil.

Elder follows her into the house. Interior colors bleed red. She closes the door; walks over to the alarm pad and enters 666.

TINA (cont'd)

Here Phil. Where are you boy?

A big Doberman comes out of a room and shows it teeth. Elder looks like a statue. Tina walks up the stairs.

TINA (cont'd)

Phil will entertain you while I slip into something less restrictive.

Elder takes a step for the door, but Phil moves in the way.

TINA (cont'd)

Oh, Elder. Would you come upstairs and help me with something?

Phil steps toward Elder forcing him to walk backwards up the stairs.

INT. TINA’S HOUSE - LANDING

Tina stands outside of her bedroom in provocative nightwear.

TINA

It’s in here.

Phil takes another step towards Elder and shows his teeth.

Tina walks into her bedroom. Red - it’s the devil’s den. 

TINA (cont'd)

Don’t be shy. This won’t take long.

INT. TINA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM

Elder steps into her bedroom, and Phil pushes the door closed.

TINA

How about a drink before you help me?

Tina walks over to a bar and starts to pour drinks. 

Elder opens the door to the landing and sees Phil. Phil shows his teeth.

Elder closes the door and walks to the balcony door leading to a staircase to the outside. He opens the door and the ALARM sounds.

TINA (cont'd)

Phil!

EXT. TINA’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

He runs down the steps and around the house to the driveway. 

He jumps into the car and drives towards the gate. 

The front door opens.

TINA

Phil!

Phil chases him. 

Elder gets to the gate. It doesn’t open. He turns the car onto the grass and starts driving around the property.

Elder drives through some bushes into a neighbor’s yard.

He looks for a way out.

INT. CAR DEALER - SALES OFFICE - DAY

Trema walks in.



That didn’t take long.

TREMA

When am I going to see this new guy?



He’s on a demo. You can meet him when he gets back.

 (cont'd)

What did the doctor say?

TREMA

I never made it. Some maniac put me in the ditch. But I got a good look at him. He looked familiar.

EXT. BEVERLY HILLS

Elder crashes through bushes into another yard barely missing a swimming pool.

He sees a front gate closing and drives for the entrance.

Elder enters the street crossing the center line; forcing Trema’s convertible off the road.

EXT. CAR DEALER - LOT - DAY

A salesman comes up to Elder.

SALESMAN

I need a turn. The sister is asking me some tough questions. Maybe if she knows you can’t talk she will shut up and buy the car.

Elder follows the salesman to a YOUNG WOMAN and her SISTER standing by a used car. The girls, fashionable dressed, are in vogue with an LA style. 

Elder writes; shows the note.

YOUNG WOMAN

Our dad wants us to look at some cars. What do you think of this one?

Elder writes; shows the note.

YOUNG WOMAN (cont'd)

That’s what I think. You and my dad would get along fine. He knows all about cars. What else do you have?

Elder motions for them to follow him. They look at another car. It’s nice.

YOUNG WOMAN (cont'd)

Okay. We want to know the best price.

INT. CAR DEALER - SHOWROOM

Ana comes over to the table where the girls sit.

YOUNG WOMAN

Who’s this?

ANA

Hi, I’m Ana. This is newbie’s first day, and he doesn’t know anything. So, I’m going to help you.

They look at Elder. He appears embarrassed.

ANA (cont'd)

Newbie, get these nice girls some water.

GIRL

I would like a soda.

The girls appear annoyed. Elder goes off to get the drinks.

ANA

Newbie says you want the best price. Have you driven the car?

YOUNG WOMAN

We don’t need to drive the car until we know we can afford it.

ANA

How’s your credit?

The sisters look irritated. 

YOUNG WOMAN

What’s my credit have to do with the selling price of the car?

A little boy plays with toys under a nearby table.

ANA

You’re going to finance aren’t you? We have really great terms.

YOUNG WOMAN

Do I look like I need to finance a car?

ANA

Well, no. But, how do you know if you’re getting a good deal if you don’t drive the car?

The girls look at Elder coming across the showroom with the drinks. 

The little boy pushes a car into his path.

GIRL

Our dad’s a mechanic. He knows a good deal when he see it. 

ANA

(agitated)

Look sweetie, I know you think you know how to buy a car, but ....

Elder, watching the escalating drama; steps on the toy car, and throws the drinks on Ana’s back. 

Ana SCREAMS and jumps up.

ANA (cont'd)

You idiot! Look what you’ve done.

The girls smile and get up. Elder stands there speechless.

ANA (cont'd)

Wait. I’m not done telling you.

YOUNG WOMAN

Save your breath... You'll need it to blow up your date.

Sister walks by him with her head slightly turned.

YOUNG WOMAN (cont'd)

(sotto)

Thanks Elder. You’re a prince.

EXT. CAR DEALER - LOT

, and Ana - smoldering, stand outside the showroom smoking.

ANA

Shit, . Get rid of that guy before he kills us.



Give him a chance. He’ll be good for the store. Mrs. Clark loves him, and she isn’t going to press charges. 

ANA

Is she going to buy a car.



Well, no, but we need some young blood. There’s going to be some changes tomorrow after the meeting.

We see two old guys sleeping at a table. They look like Statler and Waldorf from the Muppets.

ANA

Start with Lola’s boyfriends.

INT. CAR DEALER - SHOWROOM - DAY

Elder walks into the sales office with a sheet of paper and hands it to .



What have you got?

 looks at it.

 (cont'd)

Where’s Ana?

Elder points to Ana at a table in the showroom. She sits with customers and another salesman.

Elder writes; shows the note.

 (cont'd)

So, he wants a huge discount? Come on. I’ll give you some training.

CUBICLE

A elfish-small customer, a STUTTERER, sits and swings his short legs forward to touch the desk.  sits down at the desk and faces him. 



(stuttering)

I’m  Brevil, the sales manager. I can’t sell you the car for this. I own the car for more. So, I need for you to be a little flexible on the price.

STUTTERER

(stuttering)

Blue Book says that your car is way overpriced.

 hears the stutter mimic and shows her irritation.



They don’t sell cars, do they. This car is a creme puff for it’s age. 

STUTTERER

I saw this car online before I came. I called my credit union, and they say they won’t finance that much without a big down payment.



We’ll finance you here.

The conversation heats up.

STUTTERER

Yeah, at a really high interest rate. What about the high price of the car?



Do you like the car?

STUTTERER

No, I hate it. Why am I sitting here listening to you blab if I wasn’t interested?



Are you making fun of me?

STUTTERER

Are you making fun of me?

Elder appears scared.



Look, you little dweeb. Making fun of me isn't going to get you a better deal.

STUTTERER

f...uck y...ou. You’re the one making fun of me.



Well, f...uck y...ou too.

STUTTERER

F...uck y...ou!



f...uck y...ou!

FLASHBACK: INT. AMUSEMENT PARK - DAY

A younger Trema waits in line for a fun house ride with her younger daughters.



I don’t want to go on that one.

TREMA

Then you wait here for us.

Trema and Ana get in the rail car and enter the tunnel.

 wanders off into the midway.

Godmother walks on the midway with a younger Elder and Vidia. They stop to look at a freak show.

Godmother turns to watch  picking pockets. 

 sees a couple throwing balls at bowling pins and slides up and takes the boy’s wallet.

Godmother sees her in the act and magically appears in front of her.

GODMOTHER

You need to give that back to the boy.



Who the hell are you? You don’t tell me what to do.

GODMOTHER

That’s stealing, and I won’t let you do it.



Fuck you, you old hag.

Godmother smacks her across the lips with the wand.

 (cont'd)

(stuttering)

Aaah! What d...id y...ou do t...o me? 

GODMOTHER

Give it back or the next smack will be on your butt, and you won’t like that effect.

FLASHBACK: INT. FUN HOUSE

Darkness fills the tunnels but for the occasional appearance of figures designed for fun and horror. The RUMBLING rail car continues on the track. 

HALL OF MIRRORS

The rail car stops. Evil faces of gangsters from the 1930s appear to come out of the mirrors as they grow in size; their LAUGHTER echos.

The gangsters fade and a small face of a woman appears in the mirror; it grows, and we see Godmother in eighteenth century clothes.

GODMOTHER

I know what you did Trema. You will pay for your treachery.

Petrified, Trema grabs Ana. Ana screams. 

Angry fairies swirl in the air like an attach of killer wasps.

Godmother dissolves to a scene where we see THREE MICE trapped in a cage. The cage is on a road. 

We see a carriage drawn by horses rapidly approaching. 

MOUSE #1 (V.O.)

Be brave lads.

MOUSE #2 (V.O.)

Our fate awaits.

MOUSE #3 (V.O.)

Dammit. I forgot to pay the electric bill.

We hear CLOPS and a CRUNCH as the carriage runs over the cage.

Trema and Lucy grin at the side of the road.

EXT. CAR DEALER - LOT - DAY

Priscilla carries a shoulder bag and walks to the showroom door.

She turns to look at the blazing afternoon sun. Elder comes out the door and knocks her down.

He leans over to help. She reaches up and grabs his arm; sunlight bounces off his gold cuff link and into her eyes.

We see Godmother walk by.

Stunned, she gathers her sensibilities; sees that Elder is gone and looks to the ground to see the gold cuff link.

INT. PSYCHOLOGIST OFFICE - HALLWAY - DAY

We see name placard on the door - DR. JOHN REED, CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST.

WAITING ROOM

Elder sits in a chair.

RECEPTIONIST

Doctor Reed will see you now.

The receptionist opens a door for him.

PRIVATE ROOM

Dr. Reed walks to Elder.

DR. REED

Elder, it’s good to see you again. What’s going on?

Elder writes; shows the note.

DR. REED (cont'd)

Sit down, let’s talk about this.

Elder sits.

DR. REED (cont'd)

If I remember correctly, this would be your first job. Congratulations. I hope it works out for you.

Elder squirms in his seat.

DR. REED (cont'd)

Are you still taking your medications?

Elder nods. 

DR. REED (cont'd)

Good. Are they working?

Elder nods.

DR. REED (cont'd)

Then we won’t change a thing.

(beat)

Now about your job. First, put your fears to rest. Ask questions, because people like to talk about themselves.

Elder writes; shows the note.

DR. REED (cont'd)

Be honest. You might tell them that you are sometimes forgetful. Use your fidget. It will help you concentrate.

Elder takes out his rubber ball and squeezes it.

DR. REED (cont'd)

Also, use a secret signal. You can ask them for help by using “a non-verbal signal. For example, they raise a finger to indicate that you should stop talking and listen.

Elder writes; shows the note.

DR. REED (cont'd)

Watch the other salesman. Pay attention to how they handle conversations.

Elder writes; shows the note.

DR. REED (cont'd)

Don’t say Fuck You.

INT. CAR DEALER - SALES OFFICE - DAY

Trema and  sit in the office. 

TREMA

Where is this new salesman who Ana hates? 



I assume he’s outside looking for customers.

TREMA

Bring him in to me. I want to see for myself if he’s a problem.

Priscilla walks in.

PRISCILLA

Good afternoon.

TREMA

Good afternoon my dear. What brings you here today?

PRISCILLA

Stopping by to check on things for tomorrow morning. Will everyone be there?

TREMA

Of course. We made it mandatory that all employees attend.

PRISCILLA

Good. I found this laying on the ground outside. Do you know who it belongs to?

She shows them the gold cuff link.

TREMA

It’s beautiful. I’m sure it belongs to one of my daughters.

’s face glows with greed.



It’s probably mine.

PRISCILLA

What is it?



I don’t know. Probably fell out of my purse.

She reaches for it.

PRISCILLA

Looks like a man’s cuff link to me.

Priscilla puts it back into her pocket.

PRISCILLA (cont'd)

I’ll show it to everyone in the meeting tomorrow. Maybe someone will claim it.

(beat)

One other thing. You’re being sued again.

TREMA

What for?

PRISCILLA

You sold a couple a defective car. The complaint is that the vehicle had more miles and damage than advertised.

TREMA

I remember that phone call. They found the car on the Internet.

PRISCILLA

If true, it’s a violation of the Odometer Act. The plaintiffs say it was a breach of contract and seek to rescind the transaction. 

TREMA

We shipped that car to Kansas on a flat bed. The driver probably took it for a joy ride.

PRISCILLA

They say that there were signs of repairs made to the body, such as cracks and peeling paint.



He must have wrecked it and tried to fix it himself.

PRISCILLA

In addition, the California Attorney General filed suit yesterday accusing you of failing to provide consumers with motor vehicle titles.

TREMA

I’ll have a talk with our title clerk.

PRISCILLA

They filed an injunction and seek declaratory relief, restitution, and civil penalties.



We probably couldn’t get hold of the customers.

PRISCILLA

Expect another suit claiming the falsifying of income statements and using fictitious trade-ins to help customers qualify for financing on vehicles they could not afford.



That’s on Skippy. We’ll talk to him.

PRISCILLA

Ladies, these incidents smell of deceptive business practices. You may be liable individually. Your business manager certainly is.

TREMA

Sam never worried about stuff like that.

PRISCILLA

Sam never had these problems. He ran an honest business. With all due respect, Sam would rise from his grave if he knew how his car store had deteriorated.

EXT. CAR DEALER - LOT

Elder stands outside the showroom when Jaben walks up with a couple of senior citizens.

JABEN

Elder, this is Toni and Erik. They are looking for a self-driving car. I tried to explain to them that they aren’t available for a few years. Maybe you can help them.

Elder writes; shows the note.

JABEN (cont'd)

Maybe you should show them the car that parks itself. It’s that car over there.

Jaben points to a Ford Taurus.

ERIK

We might as well look at it. We have a Taurus now, and it’s been a good car.

TONI

We really want a car that does everything. One that can take us home when we’ve had too much wine.

They walk over to the Ford Taurus.

ERIK

How does this work?

Elder shrugs his shoulders and then raises his finger and walks off leaving them looking inside the car.

He comes back with the keys and the owner’s manual.

ERIK (cont'd)

Let me see that manual.

INT./EXT. TAURUS

Elder opens the back door for Toni. Eric sits in the front passenger seat. Elder sits behind the wheel.

ERIK

Well, the first thing is we have to drive down a street that has parked cars. Then, when the car sees a space it will alert us. Let’s give it a try.

They drive into an upscale residential neighborhood with manicured lawns and tendered landscaping. There appears to be lots of places to park the car.

ERIK (cont'd)

Let’s see. It says to press the Park Assist button. Here it is.

He presses a button on the center console. They drive by several parked cars. The car ALERTS them to a space.

ERIK (cont'd)

Here’s one.

Elder stops the car.

ERIK (cont'd)

Good. Now, it says to put the car into reverse; take your hands off the wheel; and let the car park itself.

TONI

That doesn’t sound right Erik. Are you sure? Read it again.

Erik looks at the manual and then out the window looking for the curb.

ERIK

Oh yeah. The car needs to see the curb, and the driver must control the gas pedal and brake.

Elder puts the car into reverse and the steering wheel spins out of his hands as the car moves quickly towards the parking space.

ERIK (cont'd)

I don’t see a curb.

The car takes off across the grass; spins 180 degrees and unaided, the gear shift snaps back to drive and heads back to towards the street. Elder steps on the brakes, but “Christine” is unfeeling.

We see torn up grass as Christine rips down the sidewalk darting her emblem nose and slanted glass eyes towards the street for access to the pavement.

Christine enters the street. Tires squeal as she accelerates towards a busy intersection. 

At the red light she pulls up to Archie in his delivery truck and rolls down the driver’s window.

A surprised Archie looks at Elder. Elder raises his hands as to say “what can I do” when the light turns green and Christine spins her rubber soles leaving a trail of smoke.

After several blocks and knuckle-biting turns, Christine pulls into a driveway and stops. Everyone appears to be a bit spooked.

TONI

I guess it works okay. But, there’s one problem. This isn’t our house. We live across the street.

Elder takes his medication.

INT. PRISCILLA’S CAR - DAY

Priscilla, parked at the curb, sees Jackie coming towards her. Jackie gets in.

JACKIE

How did it go at the car store?

PRISCILLA

Okay, I guess. I think everyone will be at the meeting tomorrow. Why don’t you come with me. Then, we can go to lunch and have some fun. Maybe some shopping to get my mind off of work.

JACKIE

You seem a bit out of sorts.

PRISCILLA

I feel really strange. It’s like I had this great meal, and I can’t remember what I ate. 

FLASHBACK: INT. PALACE - BALLROOM - NIGHT

It’s a night of celebration, and Jackie dances with Elder, the son of the King and Queen. She is wearing glass slippers.

The KING is watching. He looks like Sam, the deceased car dealer.

The QUEEN sits by his side at a banquet table. She looks like Priscilla.

QUEEN

They are perfect for each other.

The king nods in agreement.

Elder and Jackie return to the head of the table. We see Trema, , and Ana seated at the opposite end. 

The king stands and makes a toast.

KING

Welcome guests. Tonight we are gathered to honor my son on his 21st birthday.

The guests stand and raise their glasses.

KING (cont'd)

His mother and I have a special gift for him.

He looks at the queen. She stands and looks at Elder.

QUEEN

My son the prince.

She opens a beautiful jewelry box. Gold cuff links dazzle our eyes.

She takes the cuff links and exchanges them for those on his shirt.

ELDER

Thank you mother and father. I will cherish these always.

We see the clock: a few minutes before midnight. Jackie gets up and runs for the door.

ELDER (cont'd)

Wait. Where are you going?

FLASHBACK: EXT. PALACE - STEPS

Jackie runs down the steps. We see a pumpkin coach waiting. She looses a slipper, but doesn’t stop and enters the coach.

Elder runs down the stairs; trips; rolls and lands spread eagle on his back as the coach pulls away. He picks up the glass slipper and stares at the coach as it disappears into the darkness.

EXT. CAR DEALER - LOT - DAY

Elder helps a woman get out of the driver’s seat in a small car. The FAT LADY has enough fat to make another human. 

ROGER, small and thin, shows signs of physical abuse. He sits in the back seat.

FAT LADY

Well, just don’t stand there. Help me get out.

Elder pulls on her arm, but it’s not enough.

FAT LADY (cont'd)

Roger, get off your worthless ass and help me.

Roger gets out and pushes from the passenger side. They struggle to move her. 

Elder grabs her leg and pulls as it pops out, and she finally stands up.

Elder writes; shows the note.

FAT LADY (cont'd)

I don’t want another car. This one fits perfectly. 

Elder takes out his sanitizer and cleans his hands as they walk to the showroom. 

INT. CAR DEALER - SHOWROOM - DAY

In a partitioned corner area an employee duck-tapes a chair leg. He gets a PAGE and leaves the duck tape on the table.

VOICE #4 (O.S.)

Jimmy. You’re needed in Service.

Elder and his customers come into the showroom and sit at a table in the corner area. Roger helps his wife sit on the duct taped chair.

Elder writes; shows the note.

ROGER

He says the car gets great mileage. We should buy it.

FAT LADY

Just shut up Roger. I wish I hadn’t brought you.

Elder writes; shows the note.

FAT LADY (cont'd)

You’re obviously new. I may love to shop, but I'm not buying your bullshit. Sorry, the EPA says 24 in the city.

Elder gets up; motions that he will be back, and leaves. 

Roger looks nervous.

ROGER

Yes dear. Of course, you are right. He's a few clowns short of a circus.

FAT LADY

Shut up! 

She points to the duct tape.

FAT LADY (cont'd)

I'm already visualizing that duct tape across your mouth.

ROGER

Sorry, sweetie. I’m just trying to agree with you.

FAT LADY

And, don’t joke with me. You know I’m scared of clowns.

A midget CLOWN comes into the showroom and walks up to Elder.

CLOWN

I’m looking for my wife. She’s in the business office trying to buy a car without me.

Elder motions for the clown to follow him. They walk around a corner where the fat lady sits. 

Elder steps back and points to the business office. 

The fat lady, three feet from the clown, SCREAMS and the chair collapses. 

The clown straddles her and tries to pick her up. She kicks him in the groin. He grabs himself and falls to the floor.

Roger slips out of his chair and laughs uncontrollably. 

INT./EXT. CAR DEALER - SHOWROOM

Ana stands over the fat lady as the ambulance drivers come inside with two stretchers. 

We see them put the fat lady and the clown on stretchers and carry them outside.

EXT. CAR DEALER - LOT

Ana smokes and  checks her nails under the shade of a tree.



How did he know? He came to get you didn’t he? These things happen. He is so handsome.

ANA

He’s got you under his spell. You need to get rid of him before we get another visit from the fuck-up fairy. And, you know I hate fairies.



How’s the clown?

ANA

They packed his juggles in ice. I think he’s been to his last circus.

EXT. CAR DEALER - LOT

All of the salespeople tend to customers. A young girl walks up to  Elder as a customer walks away. She carries a large shopping bag.

YOUNG GIRL

Are you busy?

Elder shakes his head; writes a note, and shows it.

YOUNG GIRL (cont'd)

I’m thinking something sporty, but I have to let my mom decide. Maybe you can show me something while I wait for her.

Elder shows her several sports cars facing out from the showroom. She looks into the driver’s window.

YOUNG GIRL (cont'd)

This is pretty, but it won’t work. Mom says I need to learn how to drive a stick shift.

Elder takes her over to another car. It’s a Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 Super Snake.

YOUNG GIRL (cont'd)

Oh, this is nice.

She looks in.

YOUNG GIRL (cont'd)

And, it has a stick shift.

Elder tries to open the door but it’s locked. The young girl looks over Elder, and we see her MOTHER walking towards her. Small in stature, we think of Danica Patrick, the stock car driver.

YOUNG GIRL (cont'd)

What do you think mom? I like the color.

Her mother walks around the car and looks at the price sticker.

MOTHER

I don’t like the price. 

(beat)

Can we look inside?

EXT. CAR DEALER - LOT - DAY

Elder comes back with the keys.

The mother sits down behind the steering wheel.

Elder writes; shows the note.

MOTHER

He says he doesn’t know how to drive a stick and I don’t have time to teach him.

The young girl walks up to Elder and smiles.

YOUNG GIRL

My mother knows how to drive this car. You should trust her.

Elder helps the young girl into the back seat and sits up front. 

INT. MUSTANG

Elder cautiously gives the mother the keys; puts on his seat belt, and braces himself for the worse.

We hear a high performance engine SOUND. She puts the car into gear and eases it out onto the driveway.

Elder relaxes and smiles as they pull out of the lot into traffic.

EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

We see normal traffic.

MOTHER

Do you mind if I take it out on the freeway?

Elder nods.

INT./EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

MOTHER

He says I should drive where I’m comfortable.

The young girl adjusts her seat belt.

The car enters the highway. A few cars pass as the Mustang gains speed.

Elder looks out the passenger window. When he turns back he sees the ladies heads protected with helmets. 

MOTHER (cont'd)

Thank God!, some daylight.

Mother shifts down into a lower gear; steps hard on the accelerator; engine ROARS; tires smoke, and we are off to the races.

She weaves through traffic; shifting up and down. The speedometer wavers around 100. 

The young girl peers into her iPhone and checks her lipstick. Elder grips his headrest.

The car comes off the freeway, and Elder takes a deep breath.

Smoke vents from the engine compartment as they exit the car.

YOUNG GIRL

Do you like it mom?

The mother shakes her head as FLAMES erupt from inside the car.

MOTHER

I wouldn’t buy it in a fire sale.

Elder pops a pill.

INT. CAR DEALER - SALES OFFICE

 and Ana sit at their desks.

ANA

That’s his second disaster today. What did I tell you. He’s going to be the end of us.



He just needs to sell his first car. What does mom think of him?

ANA

She hasn’t met him yet. And, it won’t be love when she does.

EXT. CAR DEALER - SHOWROOM

Two GARDENERS (think Cheech and Chong) are outside planting rose bushes. We see the cemetery behind them. 

They are both stoned and sharing a big doobie.

GARDENER #1

Hey man, I’m thirsty man. I need some water man.

Lola stands at her podium; drops her glasses, and kicks them towards the door. She gets down on her hands and knees and searches for them. 

INT. CAR DEALER - SHOWROOM

Elder walks in the door; steps on them and continues to walk.

The gardeners walk in carrying their shovels.

GARDENER #2

Hey mamacita! Where’s the water fountain?

They walk towards Lola.

GARDENER #2 (cont'd)

What ya looking for grandma?

The SALESMEN are nodding off at a nearby table and come to at the sound of the gardeners. Lola crawls away from them.

OLD SALESMAN #1

They’re chasing Lola. 

OLD SALESMAN #2

Must be from the cemetery next door.

They turn to each other and laugh.

Mr. Warner walks in. She walks up to him.



Mr. Warner. What brings you back in?

MR. WARNER

I need a car.



Of course, Elder here will help you.

Elder writes; shows the note. 

Mr. Warner adjusts his glasses. They shake hands.

MR. WARNER

Nice to meet you. I don’t see that well. I saw a red car when I drove in. I want to buy that one.



Elder, why don’t you take Mr. Warner over to a table and sit with him for 

a minute. I’ll be right back.

BUSINESS OFFICE

We see Skippy sitting at his desk trying to open the urn.



Mr. Warner is back again. Where’s the paperwork from last week?

SKIPPY

Just get it done. He’ll sign anything we put in front of him.

Elder and Mr. Warner are sitting at the table.

MR. WARNER

My wife died last year. I don’t do much except take care of my yard and watch sports on TV. Do you like sports?

Elder writes; shows the note.

MR. WARNER (cont'd)

My eyes are getting so bad that I can’t really see that much anymore. My family wants me to give up my driver’s license, but I have had a car for 60 years. How would I get to the store?

Elder writes; shows the note.

MR. WARNER (cont'd)

He thinks I should be in a retirement home, but I like my independence. Do you have a family?

Elder writes; shows the note. 

Mr. Warner stares off not waiting for an answer. 

MR. WARNER (cont'd)

My wife died last year.

Elder motions to look at Mr. Warner’s lanyard.

MR. WARNER (cont'd)

My family wants me to wear this. I can’t remember why. Sometimes I forget to put it on and they get after me about it.

We see a name and phone number on the lanyard.

We hear a PAGE.



Elder, come to the sales office.

SALES OFFICE

Elder walks in; Lucy hisses.

 sits as if molded to her desk chair.



Keep him busy until Skippy gets the deal loaded into the computer. You’re going to make a ton of money on this one.

SHOWROOM

Elder sits with Mr. Warner. We see him put his cell phone in his pocket.

 walks to them with some paperwork.



We have all your paperwork from last time, so it will be easy to do the deal. 

MR. WARNER

That’s good. I don’t see that well.



We will just need your signature and you can drive away in that beautiful red car.

(beat)

Elder, will you go get the car ready. I will take Mr. Warner back to the business office.

EXT. CAR DEALER - LOT - DAY

A police car pulls up outside. It’s a K-9 car. The sheriff lets Bruno out of the back door.

SHERIFF

Out you go boy. Let’s go see what’s going on.

INT. CAR DEALER - SHOWROOM - DAY

The sheriff walks in with his dog. Lola walks up to meet him.

LOLA

Can I help you?

SHERIFF

I got an urgent message that my grandfather is here trying to buy another car. Where’s the business office?

Lola points.

HALLWAY

Lucy sticks her head out of the sales office. Bruno BARKS and tries to go for her. The sheriff holds the leash tightly.

BUSINESS OFFICE

Mr. Warner sits across a desk signing papers. Skippy pushes papers in front of him.

We hear BARKING.

MR. WARNER

That sounds like Bruno. My grandson must be here.

The sheriff blocks the doorway and casts a shadow over Skippy.

SHERIFF

Grandpa. What are you doing?

Bruno breaks from the sheriff’s grasp and goes around the desk to a spider cage on the floor, and BARKS.

Skippy jumps back out of his chair against the wall as Bruno jumps up on his chest. He’s on his toes.

SHERIFF (cont'd)

Down Bruno.

Bruno steps backwards to the sheriff’s side.

SHERIFF (cont'd)

Why are you selling my grandfather another car?

Skippy slides back down to his heels.

SKIPPY

(rattled)

He just came in and said he wanted another car.

SHERIFF

Did it ever occur to you that he may not be legally responsible for the purchase?

The sheriff looks hard at Skippy. We see that he sees the bow tie.

The sheriff looks casts his gaze to the urn on the desk.

SHERIFF (cont'd)

Nice vase. Where did you get it?

SKIPPY

Some second hand shop I think.

SHERIFF

Looks expensive. May I look at it?

The sheriff picks it up and puts it to Bruno’s nose.

SHERIFF (cont'd)

Bruno?

Bruno barks and barks.

SHERIFF (cont'd)

He recognizes the smell.

The sheriff takes his radio from his belt.

SHERIFF (cont'd)

K-9 unit 2.

DISPATCH (V.O.)

SHERIFF

 comes out of her office into the hallway.



What’s going on.

SHERIFF

Who are you?



I’m the general sales manager.

Employees are nearby watching.

SHERIFF

We’ll talk in a minute. I’m in the middle of an investigation.

EXT. CAR DEALER - LOT

Skippy, in handcuffs, turns to look back as another sheriff places him into the squad car.

Ana stands outside of the showroom door.  

ANA

(emotional)

Don’t worry Skippy. We’ll post your bail. I’ll pick you up soon.

INT./EXT. CAR DEALER - SHOWROOM

Skippy and Ana walk in to dealership via a side door.

Karmina gets out of a taxi, and walks towards the showroom. All of the salespeople except Elder run for the exits. 

She walks in the showroom. Lola, without her glasses, walks up to her squinting.

LOLA

Can I help you?

KARMINA

You old bat. Get out of my way. Find me a salesman.

Elder sits at a table. Lola walks up to him and points to Karmina. 

LOLA

Your turn.

Lola walks over to a tripod coat rack where a coat and hat are hanging and speaks to it.

LOLA (cont'd)

Can I help you?

Elder walks up to Karmina. She looks at his notepad.

KARMINA

New guy. You won’t last the week.

Elder writes; shows the note.

KARMINA (cont'd)

Oh, great. You can’t talk. This is going to be a night to remember. Do you know what you’re doing?

Elder writes; shows the note. 

KARMINA (cont'd)

No you don’t. Here’s what you do. Go get a car. Any car. I don’t care. We have to drive a car, and I don’t have a lot of time.

Elder leaves to get keys. 

EXT. CAR DEALER - DRIVEWAY

KARMINA

(disgusted)

I said a car; not a truck. 

Karmina gets behind the wheel.

KARMINA (cont'd)

It doesn’t matter. I’ve got some errands to run. You can come along, and I’ll waste your time.

She drives to the occult shop and parks.

KARMINA (cont'd)

Come with me.

INT. OCCULT SHOP - DAY

We see the old doll on the shelf behind the counter.

DWARF #1

May I help you?

KARMINA

I want that doll.

She points.

DWARF #1

I told you before that it’s not for sale.

KARMINA

I must have it.

Dwarf #1 looks at Elder and shakes his head.

KARMINA (cont'd)

I’m talking to you. Don’t look at him.

Elder writes; shows her the note.

KARMINA (cont'd)

I’m not leaving until I have that doll.

DWARF #1

Excuse me.

Dwarf #1 walks into the back room.

A female, DWARF #2, comes out.

DWARF #2

My husband tells me you want to buy that doll. I can’t sell it you.

KARMINA

I’ll give you $500 for it.

Dwarf #2 stares at her.

KARMINA (cont'd)

I’ll give you $1000.

DWARF #2

The doll is worth much more than that to the right person.

KARMINA

You’re just trying to jack up the price. How much do you want?

DWARF #2

The doll is worth $10,000 to the right person.

KARMINA

Are you saying I’m not the right person?

DWARF #2

Do you have $10,000?

 We see the dolls eyes open and close.

KARMINA

Of course, I have $10,000.

DWARF #2

Then you are the right person.

Karmina opens her purse and takes out a credit card.

Elder writes; shows the note.

KARMINA

Don’t tell me what to do. I’ll buy whatever I want.

DWARF #2

I’m sorry. I can’t take your money.

KARMINA

But, you said it’s worth $10,000 and I’m the right person. I’m giving you what you asked for.

DWARF #2

You are the right person. I don’t want your money, but you can take the doll.

Dwarf #1 comes from the back with a step stool and takes down the doll and gives it to Karmina. 

Elder and Karmina walk out of the shop.

We see the two dwarfs holding hands and dancing in circles.

They sing to the tune of the “Bitch is Back”, by Elton John.

DWARF #1

The bitch is gone....

INT. ARCH PARCEL SERVICE - DAY

Archie stands over Gloria as she sits at her desk.

ARCHIE

(angry)

Why didn’t you just pay someone to wreck my van? Like a destruction derby driver. 

GLORIA

(sobbing)

He seemed like a nice young man. You were able to get most of the packages back weren’t you.

ARCHIE

(angry)

Didn’t even deliver one package. Now I’m down to one truck and no drivers until tomorrow.

GLORIA

Calm down. You know what the doctor said about your blood pressure.

(beat)

What are you going to do?

ARCHIE

What do you think I’m going to do? I’ve got two caskets to deliver by tonight, and I don’t expect anyone to crawl out of one them and drive for me. 

GLORIA

That’s silly. There’s no bodies in them.

ARCHIE

Wanna look? And check their driver’s license this time.

GLORIA

(questioning)

The agency said he was qualified.

ARCHIE

(answered)

Qualified to be an fucking idiot. And have one of the loaders stay over to help me take these off the truck.

Gloria looks at her manifest.

GLORIA

The manifest doesn’t show the weight. Maybe they’re not so heavy.

Archie pops some pills.

GLORIA (cont'd)

The loaders went home. Maybe you could pay my brother to help you.

ARCHIE

Where’s the water bottle?

GLORIA

They came and took it. You told me to cancel the service.

Archie sits. Looks like he’s going to have a heart attack.

ARCHIE

Your idiot brother is about as useful as an ashtray on a motorcycle.

GLORIA

I didn’t know they had ashtrays on motorcycles.

EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

Karmina parks in an alley behind a night club. A low rider clings to the pavement.

She makes a phone call.

KARMINA

I’m here.

She disconnects and grabs her doll.

KARMINA (cont'd)

Come on, this is my last stop.

They go to the back door. It opens. A man stands behind the open door.

KARMINA (cont'd)

Where’s Alonzo?

The man points.

ALONZO, dressed in silk and gold chains, sits at a table.

The club’s lights are bright.

Alonzo signals for her to come over.

KARMINA (cont'd)

I need some sugar to get me by until Chico gets here.

ALONZO

Who’s the dude?

KARMINA

He’s my body guard.

ALONZO

Right. He looks like he’s the one that needs a bodyguard.

He hands her a small bag of cocaine. She gives him money.

ALONZO (cont'd)

I’m picking up Chico at the airport in a few hours. He says we are coming to get you and take care of some business. Sit down.

Alonzo lays down a dab of coke on the back of his hand and snuffs it. Karmina does the same.

KARMINA

You need to talk to Chico Alonzo. He doesn’t understand the car business. 

ALONZO

My cousin understands the distribution business. And, I understand the entertainment business. Why does he need a car business?

KARMINA

Make more money. It can be a gold mine. Tomorrow it will be mine, and I don’t trust the people who are running it now.

The lights go dim and flicker.

We hear PO PO PO PO... PO PO PO PO in a deep masculine voice.

ALONZO

What the hell? Juan, turn the lights back up.

A girl, about eight feet tall in a white funeral shroud walks towards them. Her shadow lays on the floor like a long black ruler. She wears a straw hat with dead flowers. Her face white; her eyes pitch black.

Elder gets up and grabs Karmina by the arm.

KARMINA

What are you doing?

Karmina grabs the doll and he pulls her to the door into the alley. We hear SCREAMING and PO PO PO PO.... as the door slams behind them. 

Karmina sets the doll on the seat and puts on her sun glasses.

KARMINA (cont'd)

(panting)

What was that noise? 

Elder drives. He pulls down the sun visor and looks in the mirror to the back seat. We see the Hachishakusama.

EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

ARCHIE'S PARCEL DELIVERY van is stopped at the side of the road.

A policeman walks to driver’s window of the van. We see DECEASED #1 clad in his burial clothes.

DUMB COP

License please.

DECEASED #1

Why did you stop me?

DUMB COP

Expired plates.

Deceased hands him his license. Dump cop looks at the license.

DUMB COP (cont'd)

You’re expired.

DECEASED #1

I’m in a hurry. I have to get my passenger to a hospital.

We see ARCHIE slumped on the floor.

DUMB COP

What’s wrong with him.

DECEASED #1

I’m no doctor, but I think he had a heart attack.

DUMB COP

How did that happen?

DECEASED #1

I think he had a shock.

DUMB COP

Electric?

DECEASED #1

No. He saw something he wasn’t expecting to see.

DUMB COP

What did your passenger see?

DECEASED #1

My driver’s license.

INT. CAR DEALER - SHOWROOM - NIGHT

Karmina sits and talks on her cell. The doll is on the table.

KARMINA

Chico, are you lost? Hurry up. I don’t want to sit here all night.

CHICO (V.O.)

Alonzo never pick me up. I can’t find the place.

We hear a PAGE over the intercom.

SKIPPY (V.O.)

Ana, you have a customer waiting in the business office.

BUSINESS OFFICE

Ana walks into Skippy’s office where WANDA, a customer, is standing. Wanda’s hair is covered with a turban.

SKIPPY

Ana, Wanda is done here, but somebody needs to take her home; get her title and the car she traded to us. 

Ana steps back out of the office with Wanda.

ANA

Give me a moment. I’ll be right back.

SKIPPY

And, Ana. Have Newbie bring in Karmina. I’m ready for her.

SALES OFFICE

Ana walks in.

ANA

We need to go to Wanda’s place and pick up her trade. Can I send the newbie?



(thinking)

Is he done with Karmina? 

Ana nods in agreement.

TREMA

What happened with the demented old man? 



His grandson somehow knew he was here buying another car.

TREMA

I think we have a spy working for us. I want to talk to the new guy when I get back. Bring him to me.

Trema walks out of the sales office and just misses seeing Elder.

EXT. TRUE VALUE HARDWARE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

A hardware store in a strip mall.

INT. TRUE VALUE HARDWARE

Trema examines a mouse trap in the pest control aisle. A CLERK shows a canister of poison.

CLERK

You could use either poison or set traps. 

TREMA

What’s the best choice. There’s a lot of mice. I want to kill them all tonight.

CLERK

Poison probably. You won’t have to worry about setting up the traps.

INT. CAR DEALER - SHOWROOM

Ana, Wanda, and Elder are talking.

ANA

Thank you Wanda. Newbie will go with you to get the title and your old car.

Elder writes; and shows the note to Ana.

ANA (cont'd)

We’ll take care of Karmina. 

(beat)

Wanda owns the cemetery next door. It won't take long.

Wanda shakes Elder’s hand.

WANDA

Sam was one of my dearest friends. We did business together. Do you want to drive? 

Elder rapidly shakes his head.

INT./EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

Wanda drives through the cemetery. We see an old man in dirty rags chiseling a tombstone. 

The earth has been moved beneath the headstone.

She stops the car and turns off the engine. We hear CHISELING.

WANDA

Why don’t you come with me.

They get out and walk over to the man. We see the moon through the trees.

WANDA (cont'd)

What are you doing Alfred?

He continues to chisel. The headstone reads ASSMAN Willie. 

ASSMAN

Damn it. You spelled my husband's name wrong again. It’s Willie Cassman.

FLASHBACK: EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

We see Mr. Cassman walking with his wife. She looks in the store windows and sees his reflection.

He stares at passing women, turning around to look at their bottoms. 

His wife appears annoyed at his behavior.

A passing woman turns to her friend and says something.

MR. CASSMAN

Did you hear that? She thinks I have a great ass.

MRS. CASSMAN

No Roland. She said, “What an ass”. I don’t think it was a compliment.

EXT. MORTUARY - NIGHT

Wanda drives up to the front of her mortuary. We see a hearse parked outside.

WANDA

I need to take some things out before you take it.

They walk over to the back of the hearse, and she opens the rear doors. We see a cardboard box.

WANDA (cont'd)

The embalming fluid needs to go into the basement at the end of the hall. I will get the other things.

She gives him the box.

WANDA (cont'd)

Follow me.

He turns and walks behind her. She unlocks a door; opens it, and points to the end of the hall.

WANDA (cont'd)

Take the stairs, and set it down anywhere.

The door closes. Moonlight paints the hallway floor through the window panes. Elder stops at the basement door, and sets the box on the floor. 

He opens the door and looks for the light switch; looks up, and pulls the light chain. 

He walks down the dimly lit steps with the box.

In the basement we see an incinerator. A conveyor leading to the incinerator has bodies on it.  

Elder sets the box down on an empty table when the stairway light goes out. We hear VOICES coming from tables in the room.

VOICE #1 (V.O.)

I was scared half to death. I thought she was going to kill me for buying that car. 

Elder looks for a light switch.  

VOICE #1 (V.O.) (cont'd)

Then she reached for the kitchen knife. Scared me half to death. I don’t know what happened after that.

VOICE #2 (V.O.)

You moron. Do the math. What happens if you get scared half to death twice?

The incinerator fires up and illuminates the room as the door opens to receive the bodies. 

The conveyor belt starts to move and a forearm from the first corpse raises as the body moves towards the furnace.

VOICE #3 (V.O.)

(excitedly)

Wait. Okay-okay, the car didn’t pass inspection.

The main lights come on. 

WANDA

Are you down there? The wagon is ready to go. 

Wanda walks down into the basement.

She looks at her smartphone.

WANDA (cont'd)

Downloaded a new app. I can work from home now.  

Another pale-faced body sits up on the conveyor.

BODY

Don’t do it. I’m alive. I’m alive.

Elder writes; shows the note.

WANDA

Don’t pay him any attention. Another used car salesman; they all lie. 

Another body tries to sit up on the conveyor.

Elder writes; shows the note.

WANDA (cont'd)

(vengeful)

Oh, her? Didn’t sell cars. She’s my hair colorist. I seriously told her that I was fine with my hair color. 

She pulls off her turban. We see orange hair.

WANDA (cont'd)

But, she just had to have it her way.

INT. CAR DEALER - BUSINESS OFFICE - NIGHT

Karmina walks in to the business office.

She sets the doll on a chair.

KARMINA

Twelve months of this bullshit. Let’s get it over with.

Skippy pushes a paper in front of her. 

SKIPPY

Do you think you can remember where to sign?

She signs, and he pushes another paper.

KARMINA

You creepy little man.

She signs, and he pushes another paper.

KARMINA (cont'd)

You’re the first one I’m going to fire.

She signs, and he pushes another paper.

KARMINA (cont'd)

Enough Karmina. Just sign.

She signs, and he pushes another paper.

KARMINA (cont'd)

I bet you’re a bed-wetter. I can’t see a real girl taking an interest in you.

Karmina signs more papers. Skippy reaches down to the floor and opens the door to his TARANTULA cage.

SKIPPY

I’ll go get your truck.

Skippy walks out of the office.

KARMINA

Hurry up. I don’t have all day.

Karmina lays down a line of coke on the desk. We see the tarantula climb on top of the desk as she snorts it with a straw. 

She looks up.

KARMINA POV

sees the tarantula; straightens; screams, and collapses hitting her head on the desk. 

Skippy walks back into the office, and we see Karmina on the floor. The Tarantula crawls on the desk. He picks it up and puts it back into the cage. 

Ana walks in.

ANA

What happened? Did you kill her?

SKIPPY

Of course not. I came back after looking for you. She must have slipped or something.

ANA

Where’s ?

INT. CAR DEALER - HALLWAY

 walks out of the restroom and stops at the business office.



What’s happened?

SKIPPY

I came back, and she was just laying here. 

 looks at the cocaine on the desk.



What’s that stuff? 

ANA

Well, it’s not pixie dust . What do you think it is? 

Ana reaches down and touches her neck.

ANA (cont'd)

She’s alive. We should call 911.

They all just stand there looking at the phone; wheels turning. 

 and Ana look at Skippy.

SKIPPY

She said I was going to be the first one she fired. But, swear to God, I never touched her.



Okay. Let’s all take a deep breath. She’ll probably live. 

We see that they have come to a collective epiphany.

ANA

I don’t want to start looking for a job tomorrow.



Me neither.

SKIPPY

Right.



If we deliver the car, we’ll be done with her for good. 

SKIPPY

We have to get her off the property to validate the delivery.

ANA

Well, I’m not driving her.



You don’t have to. Everybody gone?

ANA

I think so.



Where’s the car?

SKIPPY

In the driveway.



Pick her up. We gotta do this fast before she wakes up.

EXT. CAR DEALER - DRIVEWAY

Karmina has blood on her forehead and cocaine under her nose.

, Skippy, and Ana carry Karmina’s body to a used truck and place her behind the wheel. 

POV ANALOG CLOCK



Get her purse and the sales contract and put it on the front seat.

Skippy goes back into his office and returns with an envelope of papers. 

He tosses them on the front seat.

SKIPPY

I brought her a parting gift. 

He pours some vodka on her and throws the bottle onto the floorboard.

ANA

Where’s her sugar?

SKIPPY

I don’t know. Probably in her purse.

Ana grabs Karmina’s purse and searches for the cocaine. She takes some out and puts it in her bra. 

She throws the rest into the truck with the purse.



Where’s the keys?

SKIPPY

I got’em.



Put her seat belt on.

Ana reaches in and secures the seat belt. We see the clock on the dash as it approaches midnight.

 (cont'd)

Start it up.

Ana starts the engine and steps back out of the truck. A few mice jump out to the ground.

 turns the steering wheel, pointing the truck to the street. 

She puts her foot on the brake, and pulls the gear lever into drive. 

She jumps out from the door, and we watch the truck as it heads for the street.

SKIPPY

So long bitch.

The truck gains speed and heads towards the street.

INT./EXT. HEARSE - NIGHT

We see Elder driving the old hearse toward the dealership. 

Elder looks in his rear view mirror and sees the ghost of SAM (picture in the showroom). 

Elder’s eyes get big, and he looks back at the street.

We see CHICO pull up with his CREW next to Elder. 

CREW MEMBER

What are we gonna do to that lady?

CHICO

I dunno. 

CREW MEMBER

Hey, man. Let’s go. That wagon freaks me out.

CHICO

It’s red light. The po-lice got a warrant for me. I’m not takin’ chance.

A crew member in the back seat laughs.

CREW MEMBER

I see dead people man.

They all turn to look when the rear window of the hearse rolls down and Sam sticks out his ghostly head. We hear SCREAMS.

Chico steps on the gas; runs the red light and is hit by a prisoner transport van.

EXT. CAR DEALER - LOT - NIGHT

Elder pulls into the lot; parks near the showroom and gets out.

We see an unconscious Karmina being loaded into a truck. As the truck accelerates Elder runs to it.

He attempts to open the passenger door to no avail. He then runs to the front and pushes against hood. His body disappears under the bumper as the truck crosses the sidewalk into the street. 

We see his hands clinging to the bumper

Godmother miraculously appears; waves her wand, and the truck brakes to a stop.

EXT. CITY STREET - CEMETERY - NIGHT

The Sheriff’s car pulls up and Vidia gets out. The light bar atop the K-9 unit flashes. 

The sheriff drives away to the accident.

Vidia hands the urn to Godmother. 

VIDIA

We tried to do it ourselves, but it was a disaster.

GODMOTHER

In these matters, you always involve me. Mortals should never be involved. As you discovered, the spirits just won’t travel that way.

VIDIA

We want you to use their dust.

GODMOTHER

I will only need a little. The rest will go on the Fairyland Express.

We hear SIRENS in the distance.

INT./EXT. HIGHWAY

We see Skippy drive by the accident towards them.

The doll sits besides him. 

VIDIA

There’s that man again.

Godmother, with her wand, starts to walk out in front of his car but stops.

We watch Skippy’s car drive by, and we see the Hachishakusama in the back seat.

Godmother walks back.

GODMOTHER

His fate has been decided.

Elder writes; shows the note.

GODMOTHER (cont'd)

Elder. You have have come a long way towards accountability and concern for others. I am pleased. 

She waves her wand towards his throat and we see a TWINKLE.

EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

A figure, quick to duck behind a tree, escapes Trema’s view as she walks along dappled headstones in a treed corridor of light and gray shadow.

Lucy walks by her side.

TREMA

Kill as many as you can.

As she passes each grave marker rarefied apparitions arise from the ground for a quick, earth-less moment.

The trees provide little camouflage as she tosses poison pellets on the vaporous ground. Lucy sniffs one.

TREMA (cont'd)

Not for you.

We see the weak and horny hands of the figure behind a tree as he works at the knots of his tangled beard. 

With precision he moves quickly to the next tree, and we hear him COUGHING in a dry and horrible manner. 

His KNEE JOINTS report his progress as he dashes into the moonlight and places his golden snares on the grass.

Trema turns to look and sees no one; she looks down and sees a glitter from an object in the grass.

She picks it up, and we see a gold coin. Excited, she looks at the ground and sees a trail of shiny objects.

She continues to walk and comes to a partially buried casket - we only see the ornamental lid above ground level.

In the darkness, little eyes WATCH and grasses RUSTLE. 

Trema stops to collect the last coin at the foot of the casket. 

Godmother steps from the shadows; waves her wand, and the casket lid opens. Trema, startled, turns to run and looks down to the face of an aged leprechaun, his eyes close-set and the color of dried blood.

He pushes her into the casket, and mice rush to the perimeter and peer in to her SCREAMS. Godmother waves her wand; the lid SLAMS down, and we hear a MUFFLED voice; THUDDING and a VINCENT PRICE LAUGH.

EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

The Archie Delivery Van turns onto a crooked road. We see a sign - DEAD END. The van meanders through the overhang of trees passing grave markers exposed by the moonlight. 

We hear the brakes SQUEAL as the van comes to a stop in front of the mortuary. Silence; and we hear two casket lids CLOSE.

DECEASED #1 (V.O.)

We wait until morning.

DECEASED #2 (V.O.)

We should have been here hours ago Willard, but you just had to drive one more time.

DECEASED #1 (V.O.)

I find driving so relaxing. I don’t have a care in the world when I’m behind the wheel. Thank you Mabel for not screaming at me.

DECEASED #2 (V.O.)

Well, this time you didn’t fall asleep.

INT. CAR DEALER - MEETING ROOM - NEXT MORNING

Elder and Vidia walk into the meeting room. Elder, without his neon tie, wears yesterday’s clothes.

We hear Bruno barking outside of the room.

Jackie sits at the back of the room near the door.

JACKIE

(softly)

Wow. You got a job here. 

(beat)

My aunt is  reading the will.

VIDIA

He came to quit.

Trema sits uncomfortably at the front of the room with Priscilla. 

We see her neck brace; bite marks on her hands and arms, and claw marks on her face. She squints towards the back of the room at Elder.

 looks at her phone. 



It’s Skippy. He’s probably called to say he’ll be late.

We hear PO PO PO PO....

 (cont'd)

Po...postpone? I know it’s hard Skippy, but spit... it out. 

Karmina, in a leg cast; sitting in a wheelchair, and with her jaw wired shut, looks at Elder and raises her hand as to write something. Elder smiles and waves at her.

PRISCILLA

Who sold her the car?

 hands her the paperwork. She looks it over.

PRISCILLA (cont'd)

Who’s Elder Noobe?

ELDER

I am.

Everyone turns to look at Elder; they are stunned. 

JACKIE

You can talk.

Priscilla puts down the sales contract and picks up the will.

PRISCILLA

So, to continue. Sam’s will specifically states that in the event that Karmina takes delivery of a car anytime during the years probation she forfeits any claim to his estate.

Trema points to Elder.

TREMA

You! I remember you now. 

She points her index finger.

TREMA (cont'd)

You tried to kill me. You...

Elder gives Trema the finger.

Priscilla puts her hand over Trema’s mumbling mouth.

PRISCILLA

Furthermore, had it been a house deal the estate would have gone to Sam’s sister Trema. However, a salesman is credited with the sale. 

TREMA

What? No. No.

PRISCILLA

So, the salesman inherits Sam’s estate, which means, of course, this dealership. 

Everyone stares at Priscilla in disbelief.

Priscilla walks to Elder and extends her hand. She sees the cuff that’s missing the link.

She pulls the missing link from her pocket and attaches it to cuff.

PRISCILLA (cont'd)

I found this outside. I think it belongs to you.

Their eyes meet in a knowing exchange.

PRISCILLA (cont'd)

I’m Priscilla. 

(beat)

So, Elder, follow me into Sam’s office. We have a lot of paperwork to complete. And, by the way, you’re going to need a lawyer. 

Ana, her face aflame, turns to . 

ANA

Why didn’t you put me on the deal?



You never wanted me to before. She wasn’t going to take delivery anyway.

She lunges for ’s throat.

ANA

You fucked us.



(Porky Pig mimic)

Th-Th-The, Th-Th-The, Th-Th...

Priscilla turns to the group as she walks out, and in unison with the mimic she says...

PRISCILLA

That’s all folks.

We see the Warner Brothers meme, and with the image of the Hachishakusama poking her head through the colored rings, we hear

PO PO PO....
