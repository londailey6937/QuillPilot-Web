Chapter One: The Discovery

Sarah was nervous as she walked into the abandoned warehouse. It was dark and scary inside. The broken windows let in very little light, and she could barely see anything in front of her.

She felt her heart beating fast. The place smelled bad and gave her an uneasy feeling. Sarah was afraid of what might be lurking in the shadows. Everything about this place made her uncomfortable.

"This is creepy," she thought to herself. Her hands were shaking as she turned on her flashlight. The beam of light revealed old machinery and piles of trash everywhere.

The warehouse was very old and hadn't been used in years. Dust covered everything. Sarah was worried she might find something dangerous. Each room she passed seemed emptier and more desolate than the last.

She walked slowly through the space, feeling increasingly anxious. The silence was unsettling. Every sound made her jump. Sarah wondered why she had agreed to come here in the first place.

The building felt hostile and unwelcoming. Her fear grew with each step. Sarah's instincts told her to leave, but she pressed forward. She had come this far and couldn't turn back now. There was something important she needed to find in this terrible place.

Chapter Two: The Discovery (Revised - More Showing)

Sarah's breath came in shallow gasps as her sneakers crunched over broken glass. The warehouse loomed before her—rusted metal doors hanging crooked on their hinges, windows like hollow eyes staring into nothing.

Inside, the air tasted of rust and rot. Her pulse hammered against her throat. She pressed one palm against the corrugated wall to steady herself, and her fingers came away sticky with decades of grime.

A skittering sound—claws on concrete—froze her mid-step. The beam of her flashlight trembled across the floor, illuminating scurrying shadows that vanished into the corners.

"Just rats," she whispered, but her voice cracked. The flashlight's weight shifted in her sweating palm. Three deep breaths. In through the nose, out through the mouth. The technique her therapist taught her.

Overhead, something creaked. She jerked the light upward. Exposed beams crisscrossed the ceiling, draped in cobwebs that swayed like underwater plants. A single drop of water fell, hitting the concrete with an echo that seemed to last forever.

Her feet moved forward even as her mind screamed to run. Each step sent up puffs of dust that caught in her throat. The concrete was cracked beneath her, sprouting weeds that had forced their way up through impossible odds.

Twenty feet ahead, a dark doorway yawned open. Her light couldn't penetrate the blackness beyond. She took another step. Then another. The warehouse seemed to hold its breath, waiting.

A metal shelf groaned somewhere in the darkness. Sarah's stomach lurched. The sound came from deeper inside—not behind her, thank God—but ahead where she needed to go.

She swept the flashlight in a wide arc. Rusted machinery hulked against the walls like sleeping giants. An overturned forklift. Collapsed pallets. Mountains of cardboard boxes that had melted into shapeless mounds.

The door frame was cold under her fingertips. She paused there, counting her heartbeats. One-Mississippi. Two-Mississippi. Her grandmother's voice in her head: "Fear is just a feeling, sweetheart. Feelings can't hurt you."

But feelings could make you stupid. Make you careless. Sarah forced herself to scan the floor before stepping through. More glass. A dark stain that might be oil or might be something worse. A length of chain that disappeared into the shadows.

She stepped over the threshold.
